<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>MAKING THE BEST OF THINGS</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Marjorie.</span>"</p>

<p>The clear call rang out, breaking the afternoon
stillness of the ranch, but there was no response,
and after waiting a moment Miss Graham gave
her wheeled chair a gentle push, which sent it
rolling smoothly across the porch of the ranch
house, down the inclined plane, which served the
purpose of steps, to the lawn. It was very hot,
the sun was blazing down as only an Arizona sun
can blaze, and not a breath of air was stirring.
But Miss Graham was accustomed to the heat and
the glare. She paused for a moment, gazing off
over the vast prairie to the California mountains,
nearly a hundred miles away. She generally
paused on that same spot for one look, although
the landscape was the only one she had seen in
twelve years. Then she moved on again, across
the lawn, now parched and dry from the long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
summer's heat, toward the stables and out-buildings.
It was before the smallest of these out-buildings,
a tiny log cabin, that she finally brought
the chair to a standstill.</p>

<p>"Marjorie, are you there?"</p>

<p>There was a sound of some one moving inside,
and a girl of fourteen, with a book in her
hand, appeared in the doorway. She was a
pretty girl, with soft light hair that curled over
her temples, and bright, merry blue eyes, but just
now the eyes were red and swollen, and there
were unmistakable tear-marks on the girl's cheeks.
At sight of the lady in the wheeled chair, however,
Marjorie's face brightened, and she hurried
forward, exclaiming remorsefully:</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Jessie dear, did you come all this
way by yourself? I'm so sorry. Do you want
me to do something for you?"</p>

<p>"You needn't be sorry," said her aunt, smiling.
"The exercise will do me good, and I am
quite proud of being able to manage this chair so
easily. I called you from the porch, but you
didn't hear. Your mother and Juanita are busy
in the kitchen making jam, and I wasn't of any
use there, so I thought I would come and see
what you were about. I felt pretty sure of finding
you in the old playhouse."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come in," said Marjorie, eagerly. "You
haven't been in the playhouse in ages; not since I
grew too big to invite you to "make-believe"
tea, but the door is just wide enough for the
chair; don't you remember? Let me help you
in?" And springing to Miss Graham's side,
Marjorie seized the handle of the chair, and carefully
guided it through the narrow entrance, into
the little house her father had built for her own
special use, and which had always been known
as the playhouse. It might still have been regarded
as a playhouse, although its owner had
grown too old to play there. A couple of battered
dolls reposed upon a toy bedstead in one
corner, and an array of china dishes, all more or
less the worse for wear, adorned the shelves.
Marjorie loved her few possessions dearly, and
in a place where one's nearest neighbor lives
five miles away, there are not many people on
whom to bestow things which have ceased to be
useful to one's self, and they are therefore likely
to be preserved.</p>

<p>"Now we're all nice and cosy," remarked
Marjorie, seating herself comfortably on the
floor at her aunt's feet. "There wouldn't be
room for another person in here, even if there
were anybody to come. What good times we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
used to have here when I was little, didn't we,
Aunt Jessie?"</p>

<p>Marjorie spoke fast and nervously, but there
were pink spots in her cheeks, and Miss Graham
was not easily deceived.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Marjorie?" she asked
simply. She and her niece had no secrets from
each other.</p>

<p>Marjorie tried to laugh, but her lip quivered,
and the tears started to her eyes.</p>

<p>"There isn't anything the matter," she said,
frankly. "I've been a goose, that's all. It was
all the fault of the book I was reading."</p>

<p>"What book was it?" Miss Graham inquired
curiously, glancing at the volume Marjorie was
still holding in her hand.</p>

<p>"It's called 'The Friendship of Anne,' and
it's one of those in that box Father had sent from
Albuquerque. It's all about a big boarding-school
full of girls, and the good times they had
there, but somehow it set me thinking, and&mdash;and,
I don't know why, perhaps because it's been
so hot and still all day, but I began to feel as if
I wanted to cry, and so I came out here to have
it out." Suddenly Marjorie dropped her head
in her aunt's lap, with a sob.</p>

<p>For a moment Miss Graham was silent. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
stroked the soft, fluffy hair with her thin fingers,
and a look of comprehension came into her face.
When she spoke her voice was very gentle.</p>

<p>"I understand, little girl," she said tenderly.
"You haven't said much about it, but I know it
was a big disappointment that Father couldn't
afford to send you to school at Albuquerque this
winter. It was a disappointment to all of us,
much as we should have missed you, but it is one
of those things everybody has to bear sometimes."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Marjorie, checking her tears,
and making a great effort to speak cheerfully.
"It wasn't poor Father's fault that so many of
the cattle died this year, or that the drought
spoiled the alfalfa crop. I try to think that perhaps
it's all for the best, and that if I really left
you all, and went away to school, I might have
died of homesickness. But when I read that
story, and thought of all the people and things
there are in the world that I've never seen, it
was just a little bit hard to feel cheerful. Mother
teaches me all she can, and so do you and Father,
but I'm fourteen and a half, and I hate to think
of growing up without any real education. If I
were well educated, I might teach, and be a real
help to you all, but there isn't anything I can do
now but just sit still and make the best of things."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Making the best of things is what we all
have to do," said Miss Graham, smiling rather
sadly. "You do it very well, too, Marjorie dear.
Your father and I were talking last evening of
how bravely you have borne this disappointment.
We all realize what it has meant to you, but we
are not a family who are much given to talking
about our troubles."</p>

<p>"I know we're not," said Marjorie, "and I'm
glad of it. How uncomfortable it would be if
you and Mother were always saying you were
sorry for each other, and if Father looked solemn
every time a cow died. I should hate to be condoled
with, and treated as if I needed pity, but
still I can't help wishing sometimes that I could
do some of the things other girls do. Why, just
think, Aunt Jessie, I've never had a friend of my
own age in my life. I've never been on a train,
or seen a city since I can remember."</p>

<p>Miss Graham continued to stroke the fluffy
hair, and a troubled look came into her eyes.</p>

<p>"I understand, dear," she said, "and I don't
blame you in the least. I know the feelings of
loneliness and longing too well for that."</p>

<p>"Do you really, Aunt Jessie?" questioned
Marjorie, looking up in surprise. "I didn't suppose
you ever longed for anything; you're such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
an angel of patience. I suppose it's wrong, but
I can't help being glad you do, though, because
it makes it so much easier to explain things to
you. I can't bear to have Father and Mother
think I'm not perfectly happy and contented; it
makes Father look so sad, and I know Mother
worries about my education. I never thought of
it before, but you were a girl, too, when you first
came here, weren't you?"</p>

<p>Miss Graham smiled. She was only twenty-eight,
and girlhood did not seem so much a thing
of the past, but Marjorie was fourteen, and to
her twenty-eight seemed an age quite removed
from all youthful aspirations.</p>

<p>"I was just sixteen when we came out here,"
she said, "and it seemed very strange at first to
be away from all my friends, but girl-like I enjoyed
the change, and it was not for a year or
two that I began to realize what life on an Arizona
ranch really meant. Your father and
mother were very good to me, but they were absorbed
in each other, and in their work, and you
were too little to be any real company to me.
There was plenty of work to be done, and I tried
to do my share, but there were many lonely times
when I rebelled bitterly against fate. I used to
think of those times later on, after the accident,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and then it seemed strange that I should ever
have fretted over such foolish trifles, but they
were very real to me once."</p>

<p>Marjorie took her aunt's hand and kissed it.
Demonstrations of affection were rather rare in
the Graham family, but the girl could never think
of that accident without a lump rising in her
throat. She had heard the story dozens of times.
She had even a dim recollection of the day it had
happened&mdash;the day on which her pretty, merry
young aunt had started for a canter over the
prairie, on a wild young bronco, and had been
carried home white and unconscious, never to
ride, or even walk again. Just how it had all
happened nobody ever knew. An Indian boy,
coming suddenly out of a cabin, had shouted and
waved his hands to a companion. The noise had
frightened the bronco, and he had dashed off at
full speed, and Jessie Graham, experienced horsewoman
though she was, had lost her balance, and
been thrown violently to the ground, striking her
back against a sharp stone. That was eight years
ago, and during all that time her life had been
passed, first in bed, and then in a wheeled chair.</p>

<p>Marjorie rose suddenly. There were some
things it wasn't possible to make the best of, and
it was wisest not to talk about them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's getting a little cooler," she said irrelevantly;
"I think I'll saddle Roland, and go for a
ride before supper. You're an angel, Aunt Jessie,
and I'm glad you told me how you used to
feel. I'm ashamed of myself, but it makes the
disappointment easier to bear because you understand.
Shall I wheel you back to the house, or
is there anything else I can do for you before I
go?"</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later, Marjorie mounted
astride her bay pony, was trotting briskly out
over the prairie. Her aunt watched her from the
porch of the ranch house.</p>

<p>"Poor little girl," she said, with a sigh, as
horse and rider disappeared from view in a cloud
of dust, "she bears her disappointment bravely,
but it's hard&mdash;hard for her, and for us all."</p>

<p>A footstep was heard, and her sister-in-law,
Marjorie's mother, came out on the porch. Mrs.
Graham had once been very pretty, but twelve
years of hard work, and constant anxiety as to
ways and means, had brought a careworn expression
into the eyes that were so like Marjorie's,
and the hand she laid on the back of Miss Graham's
chair was rough and hardened from housework.</p>

<p>"It's been a hot day, hasn't it?" she said, "but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
it's cooler now," and she smiled the brave, cheerful
smile she had never lost through all their
troubles and anxieties. "Juanita and I have put
up six dozen jars of blackberries to-day; not a
bad day's record, is it? Have you heard the
whistle of the East Bound?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure; I thought I heard a whistle
about half an hour ago, but I have been with
Marjorie in the playhouse. We have been having
a talk."</p>

<p>"Has she said anything about her disappointment?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a little. She is bearing it splendidly,
but it is a real grief to her, notwithstanding."</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham sighed.</p>

<p>"I was afraid it would be," she said. "It
would almost have broken my heart to part from
her, but Donald and I had made up our minds
to let her go. It seemed the only way of giving
the child a chance in life, and now this disease
among the cattle has put an end to everything.
Donald says we may be able to send her next
year, but she will be nearly sixteen then, and time
is precious. I wish I knew more myself, so that
I could help my little girl, but, like so many other
girls, I wasted my time at school. O dear! if
children only realized what an education might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
mean to them some day, they wouldn't fritter
away their time, as half of them do."</p>

<p>"Susie," said Miss Graham, impulsively,
"have you ever thought of writing to your
brother Henry about Marjorie?"</p>

<p>The sensitive color rose in Mrs. Graham's
cheeks, and for a moment she looked almost as
pretty as in the days when Jessie, in the rapturous
devotion of her teens, had considered her "the
loveliest sister-in-law in the world."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have thought of it," she said, "but&mdash;but
somehow I haven't been able to make up my
mind to do it. You know my family never approved
of Donald's coming out here. My brother
offered him a position in his office in New York,
but Donald said he had no head for business, and
he loves this wild life, hard as it has been. I
have never let my people know of our difficulties;
they would have been kind, I daresay, but one
hates to ask favors."</p>

<p>"I know," said Miss Graham, comprehendingly;
"still, for Marjorie's sake&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham looked troubled.</p>

<p>"Donald and I were talking about it only last
night," she said. "It isn't right to deprive the
child of advantages she might have, but think of
sending her all the way to New York, even if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Henry and his wife were willing to take her.
Albuquerque would have been different; she could
at least have come home for the holidays, but
New York&mdash;why, think of it, Jessie, she has
never been away from us for a night in her life!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham paused abruptly, her face contracted
with pain. The tears started to Miss
Jessie's eyes, but her voice was still quite firm
when she spoke again.</p>

<p>"It would be very hard," she said, "harder
for us perhaps than for Marjorie herself, and yet
if it were the best thing to do&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the conversation was interrupted by Juanita,
the Mexican maid of all work, who appeared
with the startling announcement that the jam
was boiling over on the stove, and Mrs. Graham
hurried away to the kitchen, leaving her sister-in-law
to her own reflections.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE COMING OF UNDINE</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the meantime, Marjorie, quite unconscious
of the anxieties of her family regarding her future,
was cantering away over the prairie on her
bay pony. Having passed the last buildings of
the ranch, and trotted through the Indian village,
where more than one woman, and numerous copper-colored
children smiled a friendly greeting,
she turned her pony's head in the direction of the
railroad. The nearest town was more than
twenty miles away, but the line of the Santa F&eacute;
Railroad ran within a comparatively short distance
from the ranch, and twice every day the
stillness was broken by the whistles of the east
and west bound trains, as they rushed by on their
way across the continent, from Los Angeles to
Chicago. To watch the trains go by had been
one of the amusements of Marjorie's life, ever
since she could remember. When she was a little
girl, it had been a great treat to be taken by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
her father, on his big chestnut horse, and to have
him draw rein in full view of the tracks, and wait
to see the great iron horse come rushing by. As
soon as she was old enough to ride out by herself,
this spot had become one of her favorite afternoon
excursions. There was a wonderful fascination
in watching the long line of sleepers and
day coaches, filled with people, and to wonder
where they could all be going, and speculate as to
what might be happening on the other side of
those moving windows. Sometimes of late the
longing to know more of the outside world, and
to follow those ever moving cars, had become almost
irresistible.</p>

<p>"If I could only take one real journey I believe
I should be happy forever," she would say
to herself, and the hope of going to school at Albuquerque,
two hundred miles away, had filled
her with a wild kind of joy that was not unmixed
with fear. But now that hope had been crushed,
for the present at least, and Marjorie, who was a
sensible little soul, had decided that it might be
wiser to avoid watching the trains go by just
now. For a week she had kept away from the
line, at the hours when trains were likely to pass,
but this afternoon she felt more cheerful. The
little talk with her aunt had done her good, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
she resolved to take Aunt Jessie's advice, and try
to make the best of things. So when the pony
manifested a desire to take the familiar turning,
she let him have his way, and trotted on quite
cheerfully toward the railroad.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we're too late to-day, Roland," she
remarked aloud, as the pony plodded on bravely
through the dust and heat. "I didn't hear the
whistle, but I'm sure the East Bound must have
passed, and the West Bound went through at two
o'clock."</p>

<p>Having very few people to talk to, Marjorie
had formed the habit of talking to her live pets,
of which Roland was her favorite. Her father
had given him to her when he was only a month
old, and she had trained him herself, as soon as
he was old enough to bear the saddle, to say
nothing of the many romps the two had enjoyed
together in the days of his colthood. It seemed
to her sometimes as if Roland must really understand
some of the things she told him, and now,
at her remark about the train, he slackened his
pace to a leisurely trot, as if under the impression
that there was no use in hurrying.</p>

<p>"It is hot, isn't it, Roland?" said Marjorie,
sympathetically. "You and I will be glad when
winter comes, and we can have some fine gallops.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
I thought I might be going away to leave you this
winter, but I'm not."</p>

<p>Roland pricked up his ears, and quickened his
pace.</p>

<p>"What is it, Roland?" Marjorie inquired in
surprise. "Oh, I see, it's Jos&eacute; on his black
bronco."</p>

<p>Her face brightened, and she waved her hand
in friendly welcome to the approaching figure of
a small Mexican boy, mounted on an equally
small pony.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jos&eacute;!" she called, as the two came
within speaking distance of each other; "Do you
know whether the East Bound has passed yet or
not?"</p>

<p>"See there," said the boy, pointing in the direction
from which he had come. "Something
wrong with engine. She been there three hours.
My father tell me, and I go see."</p>

<p>"How exciting!" cried Marjorie, everything
else forgotten for the moment in the interest of
this news. "Do you think she'll stay much
longer?"</p>

<p>Jos&eacute; shook his head; he could not say. He
was a rather dull boy, but Marjorie had known
him all her life, as she had known every inhabitant,
Mexican or Indian, who had made a home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
in that desolate region. She could speak Spanish
almost as well as English, and could carry on a
conversation in two Indian dialects. She did not
wait for any more conversation with Jos&eacute; on this
occasion, however, but with a chirp to Roland to
indicate that she wished to go faster, hurried the
pony along at such a pace that in less than
five minutes they came in sight of the waiting
train.</p>

<p>No, she was not too late. The long transcontinental
express was standing still, and a number
of the passengers had left the cars and were
sauntering leisurely about. Marjorie's heart beat
fast with excitement, and she drew the pony in
sharply.</p>

<p>"We mustn't go too near, Roland," she whispered.
"Oh, look, isn't it interesting? See those
girls in shirt-waists and straw hats. They look
just about my age. How I should like to speak
to them, but I suppose they would think it queer."</p>

<p>The sight of a girl in a striped khaki skirt, with
a sombrero on her head, sitting astride a bay
pony, had quickly attracted the attention of some
of the passengers, and Marjorie soon realized
that she was being stared at in a manner that was
slightly disconcerting. Not that she was in the
least shy, but these strangers had a way of looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
at her, as if they found something amusing
in her appearance, and Marjorie did not like being
stared at any more than any other girl.</p>

<p>"I don't think we'll stay any longer, Roland,"
she said, conscious of the fact that her cheeks
were burning uncomfortably. And turning the
pony's head abruptly, she galloped away in the
direction of home.</p>

<p>But it was some minutes before her cheeks had
regained their natural color.</p>

<p>"I wonder why they stared so," she kept repeating
to herself. "Was it the sombrero&mdash;I
don't suppose girls wear sombreros in the East&mdash;or
was it something else? Oh, there's the
whistle; thank goodness they're off!" And
Marjorie gave a sigh of relief, and let Roland
drop into a trot.</p>

<p>It was still early when she reached home, and
having delivered Roland to the Indian boy, whose
duty it was to look after him, and finding that
her mother and aunt were both busy, she betook
herself once more to the playhouse, intending to
spend the hour before supper in learning more of
the fortunes of Anne and her friends. But her
ride in the heat had made her sleepy, and after
turning a few pages rather listlessly, her eyes
drooped, and letting the book slip into her lap,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
she rested her head against the wall of the cabin,
and dropped off into an afternoon nap.</p>

<p>How long she had been asleep she did not
know, but she started up, wide awake, aroused by
a sound close beside her. Then for a moment she
sat staring stupidly at the apparition before her;
for there, standing in the doorway, regarding
her with big, hungry, brown eyes, was a girl&mdash;not
a Mexican or an Indian, but a pale-faced,
dark-haired girl of about her own age, in a faded
linen dress, much too short in the skirt, and
a battered straw hat, decidedly the worse for
wear.</p>

<p>"Goodness gracious me!" gasped Marjorie in
amazement; "where in the world did you come
from?"</p>

<p>"I'm hungry," said the stranger, in a remarkably
sweet voice; "Won't you please give me
something to eat?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Marjorie, fully
convinced that this was a dream.</p>

<p>A frightened expression came into the big
brown eyes, and the girl's lip began to tremble.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said; "I can't remember.
Won't you please give me something to eat?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 318px;">
<img src="images/i-001.jpg" width="318" height="500" alt="&quot;Where in the World Did You Come from?&quot;&mdash;Page 19." title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;<span class='smcap'>Where in the World Did You Come from?</span>&quot;&mdash;Page 19.</span>
</div>

<p>"I know I'm dreaming," said Marjorie, and
she pinched her arm, but though the pinch hurt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
considerably, she did not wake up. The strange
girl continued to stand in the doorway.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;how did you get here?" she repeated;
"where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"I got off the train. I've walked ever so far,
and it was so hot. I thought there would be
houses, but there weren't any. You won't be
cross with me, will you? I'm afraid of cross
people."</p>

<p>"Why did you get off the train?" inquired
Marjorie. If this were not a dream, then it was
certainly the most extraordinary adventure she
had ever had.</p>

<p>The brown eyes filled with tears, and the
stranger clasped her hands nervously.</p>

<p>"Don't scold, ah, please don't," she pleaded;
"I'm so tired of being scolded. I got off the
train because Mrs. Hicks was so cross I couldn't
stand it any longer. She said I was a lazy, good-for-nothing
girl, and she wished she had never
promised to take me to Kansas. I said I wished
she hadn't either, and that I didn't want to go to
Kansas or anywhere else with her, and then she
said I was an impudent little wretch, and she
wished she could get rid of me. She slapped me,
too, and that made me furious, so when she sent
me to the dining-car to get some milk for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
baby, and the train was standing still, I just got
off. I don't want to stay with people who don't
like me, and I can't stand being slapped."</p>

<p>"But think how frightened your friend must
have been when the train started and you didn't
come back," said Marjorie, reproachfully. She
did not know quite what to make of this singular
young person, who appeared to think nothing of
deserting her friends, and wandering off by herself
on the prairie.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hicks isn't my friend, and she won't
care, anyway; she'll be glad to get rid of me. I
heard her telling a woman on the train that I
was an awful nuisance, and she couldn't think
why she had ever promised her sister to take me
to Kansas with her. She doesn't want me&mdash;nobody
wants me, nobody in the whole world!"
And suddenly this extraordinary visitor put both
hands before her face, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>Marjorie sprang to her feet, wide awake at
last. She had not seen many people cry, and the
sight always affected her deeply.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't, please don't!" she cried, and almost
without realizing what she was doing she
had slipped an arm about the shaking shoulders.
"We'll take care of you, of course we will, and
you can tell us about everything. Oh, please do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
stop crying; you make me so very uncomfortable."</p>

<p>But the brown-eyed girl did not stop crying.
On the contrary, she cried all the harder, and
buried her face on Marjorie's shoulder.</p>

<p>"You're kind, oh, you're kind!" sobbed the
poor child, clinging convulsively to her new
friend. "Nobody was ever kind to me before
except old Mr. Jackson, and now he's dead. I've
been so miserable, and it's so dreadful not to remember
anything, not even my name."</p>

<p>"Your name?" repeated Marjorie stupidly;
"do you mean you don't even know your own
name?"</p>

<p>The stranger shook her head mournfully as she
searched for a missing pocket-handkerchief.
Marjorie supplied the handkerchief from her own
pocket, and sympathetically wiped her visitor's
eyes.</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," she said doubtfully;
"I never heard of a person's not knowing her
own name. Haven't you any relatives?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I had once, but I can't remember
them. The first thing I remember is waking up
in a hospital. It was just after the earthquake
in San Francisco, and they told me I was found
in the street under some ruins. They thought a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
stone or something must have fallen on my head,
and that was what made me forget everything.
Nobody knew whom I belonged to, and I had
only a nightgown on when I was found, so they
couldn't trace me by my clothes. At first the
doctors thought I would remember soon, and
they used to ask me questions, but I never could
answer any of them. They kept me at the hospital
a long time, but I was always frightened
because I couldn't remember anything. At last
when I was strong again, and nobody came to
look for me, they said they couldn't keep me there
any longer. They sent me to the 'Home For
The Friendless in Oakland,' but I had only been
there a week when Miss Brent came to look for a
girl to run errands, and carry home parcels.
They told her about me, and she said she would
take me, because I might have rich friends, who
would come for me, and pay her well for taking
care of me. So I went to live with her, and she
put an advertisement about me in the newspapers.
For a long time I kept hoping some one would
come for me, but nobody ever did. Miss Brent
was a dressmaker, and she had a lot of girls
working for her, but I didn't like any of them,
they were so rough, and they used to laugh at me,
and call me 'loony.' Miss Brent called me Sally,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
but I know that isn't my real name. I got so
tired running errands, and carrying the heavy
boxes home made my back ache. I don't think
I could have stood it if it hadn't been for Mr.
Jackson. He boarded with Miss Brent, and lived
in a little room on the top floor. He was very
old, and nobody paid much attention to him, but
I was sorry for him, and I used to carry up his
meals, and he talked to me so kindly. He never
made fun of me, because I couldn't remember,
but he lent me books to read, and asked me questions
like the doctors at the hospital. It's very
queer, but I could always remember how to read.
I can write, too, and I can even remember things
in history, but I can't remember a single thing
about myself. Mr. Jackson said he was sure my
memory would come back some day, and then I
would be able to find my friends. He died last
winter, and after that it was dreadful. Miss
Brent was always busy and cross, and the girls
were worse than ever. A month ago Miss Brent
told us she was going to be married, and give up
the business, and that all the girls would have to
leave. Most of them didn't mind, because they
had homes, but Miss Brent said she didn't know
what in the world to do with me. She didn't
think any one would take me, because I wasn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
strong enough to do hard work, and she was
afraid I was too old to go back to the 'Home For
The Friendless.'</p>

<p>"The wedding was last week, and Mrs. Hicks
came on from Kansas. She is Miss Brent's sister,
and her husband has a big cattle farm. Mrs.
Hicks brought her baby with her, and they got
me to help take care of it, and then Miss Brent
persuaded her sister to take me home with her.
I didn't want to go, for I knew I shouldn't like
Mrs. Hicks, but Miss Brent said I must. We
started yesterday, and it was awful. Mrs. Hicks
kept saying she knew I would never be any use
to her, and the baby was so heavy, and cried all
the time. I had just about made up my mind to
run away when Mrs. Hicks slapped me, and that
settled it. I never was slapped before, and I
couldn't stand it."</p>

<p>The brown eyes flashed indignantly, and there
was a crimson spot in both the girl's cheeks.
Marjorie had been listening to this strange story
in breathless astonishment. It did not occur to
her for a moment to doubt its truth. Before she
could ask any more questions, however, she was
brought back to a recollection of every-day life
once more by the sound of her father's voice calling
from the porch:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Supper's ready, Marjorie."</p>

<p>Marjorie came down to earth with a rush, and
hastily explaining to her new friend that she
would be back in a minute, dashed away to the
house, there to electrify her family with the astounding
news that there was a strange girl in
the playhouse, who had walked all the way
from the railroad, and didn't know her own
name.</p>

<p>When Marjorie returned five minutes later,
she was accompanied by an excited group, consisting
of Mr. and Mrs. Graham, Miss Jessie,
and the Mexican servant, Juanita. At sight of so
many strangers the visitor shrank into a corner,
and her eyes seemed to grow bigger and more
frightened than ever, but when Mrs. Graham
spoke to her in her kind, motherly voice, the pale
face lighted up, and holding out both hands to
Marjorie's mother, she exclaimed joyfully:</p>

<p>"You're kind, too; I can see it in your face.
Oh, please don't send me away; I'm so tired and
hungry, and I don't know where else I can possibly
go."</p>

<p>"And what are we to call you, my dear?"
Mrs. Graham inquired, late that evening, when
the uninvited guest had been refreshed by a bath
and a hearty supper, and was lying back comfortably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in the big rocker in the living-room. "Did
I understand Marjorie to say that you had been
called Sally?"</p>

<p>The stranger pouted. Now that her face was
washed she was really very pretty.</p>

<p>"I hate 'Sally,'" she said, impatiently; "it's
not my name, and I don't see why I need be
called by it. I wish you'd call me something
pretty."</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham looked a little doubtful, but Marjorie,
who was regarding this singular young
person in a kind of fascinated awe&mdash;half expecting
to see her vanish at any moment as mysteriously
as she had come&mdash;hastened to the rescue.</p>

<p>"I've thought of a beautiful name for her,
Mother," she said, eagerly. "Why can't we call
her Undine&mdash;at least till she remembers what
her name really is? She didn't come out of a
fountain, but she really did come almost as mysteriously
as Undine came to the fisherman's hut,
in the story. Would you like to be called Undine,
Sally?"</p>

<p>"I should love it," declared the visitor in a
tone of satisfaction and as Marjorie generally
had her way, and Undine really seemed as good
a name as any other, the matter was settled, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the new Undine fell asleep that night, happier
than she had ever been since that strange waking
in the California hospital, more than two years
before.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>TRYING TO REMEMBER</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">And</span> so Undine went back into the fountain,
carrying the knight, Hildebrand, with her, and
nobody ever saw either of them again. I always wished
it hadn't ended there, but had gone
on to tell what became of the fisherman and his
wife, and all the other people. That's the great
trouble with stories; they are so apt to end just
where you want to hear more. If I ever wrote
a book I should put a chapter at the end, telling
what became of all the characters afterward."</p>

<p>The two girls were sitting together on the
porch; Marjorie busily engaged in darning stockings;
the new Undine patiently hemming a towel.
It was a week since the arrival of "the mysterious
stranger," as Marjorie called her, and she
had already become an established member of the
household. Marjorie accepted the mystery of a
girl who didn't know her own name, and who apparently
belonged to nobody, just as she would
have accepted any other girl friend who might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
have come into her rather uneventful life. It
had never even occurred to her to doubt the truth
of Undine's strange story. The rest of the
family had not been quite so easily satisfied, and
for several days Mr. and Mrs. Graham had been
inclined to regard the stranger with some doubt,
even suspicion; but there was something very
winning about this new Undine&mdash;she seemed
such a simple, innocent child&mdash;so grateful for
every kindness, and so eager to be of use in
the household&mdash;that they gradually found themselves
coming to believe in her, in spite of appearances.</p>

<p>"I am sure the child is telling the truth as far
as she knows it," Aunt Jessie had said to her sister-in-law
that morning. "It all sounds very
strange and incredible, I know, but I can't doubt
the truth in those honest eyes of hers. I am
really growing quite fond of her already." To
which Mrs. Graham had replied, with a smile:</p>

<p>"We shall know when Donald receives the
answers to the letters he sent to the Home in
Oakland and to the dressmaker."</p>

<p>As Marjorie concluded her remarks on the
story of Undine, she glanced critically at her
friend's work.</p>

<p>"You are hemming much better to-day," she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
said in a tone of satisfaction; "I am sure Mother
will say you have improved."</p>

<p>Undine's face brightened.</p>

<p>"I hope she will&mdash;oh, I do hope so!" she
said eagerly. "She is so dear, and I want to
please her so much, but I'm afraid I'm very
stupid."</p>

<p>"You are not stupid at all," declared Marjorie
loyally. "You are much cleverer than I
am about lots of things. It isn't your fault if
you've never been taught to sew."</p>

<p>"There wasn't any time to learn at Miss
Brent's," said Undine; "there were always such
a lot of errands, and so many parcels to be carried
home. I suppose if I had learned before the
earthquake I shouldn't remember now."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Marjorie thoughtfully;
"you must have learned to read, and you haven't
forgotten that."</p>

<p>"No, nor to write either. It's very queer
about the things I remember and those I don't.
Mr. Jackson used to asked me a great many questions,
and he wrote down some of the things I
told him, to show to a society he belonged to.
Once a very funny thing happened. I had taken
a dress home to a lady, and was waiting in the
hall while she tried it on, to see if it had to go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
back for any alterations. There were some people
in the parlor talking French. I don't know
how I knew it was French, but I did, and I understood
almost everything they said. I told Mr.
Jackson, and he was so interested. He made me
tell Miss Brent, too, and he wanted her to put another
advertisement in the newspapers, but she
said she hadn't any money to waste in advertising,
and that if I had any relatives they would
have come for me long ago."</p>

<p>"It's the most interesting thing I ever heard of
in my life," declared Marjorie. "Aunt Jessie
says she is sure your friends must have been educated
people, because you never make mistakes
in grammar."</p>

<p>Undine looked pleased.</p>

<p>"I'm glad your aunt thinks that," she said.
"I should hate to talk in the way some of the
girls at Miss Brent's did. They used to laugh at
me and call me stuck up, but I didn't want to be
like them. I hate rough girls. I dream about
my mother sometimes, and I know she would be
sorry to have me grow up rough and coarse."</p>

<p>"It seems so strange that you can't even remember
your mother," said Marjorie, reflectively.
"I can't imagine that anything could possibly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
happen to me that would make me forget
Mother."</p>

<p>A shadow crept into Undine's face, and the
troubled, frightened look came back into her
eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, wearily; "I don't
know anything. Oh, Marjorie, it frightens me so
sometimes."</p>

<p>There was a quiver in the girl's voice, and
kind-hearted Marjorie laid a protecting hand on
hers.</p>

<p>"Never mind," she said, soothingly; "don't
think any more about it than you can help.
Perhaps it will all come back some time; Father
thinks it will. He thinks the stone, or whatever
it was, that fell on you, must have given your
brain a terrible shock. He says he heard of a
man once who was very badly hurt in a railroad
accident, and couldn't remember anything for a
long time. His family thought he must be dead,
but suddenly his memory all came back to him,
and he went home, and gave them a great surprise.
Perhaps it will be like that with you some
day."</p>

<p>"Miss Brent thinks all my people must have
been killed in the earthquake," said Undine, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
a sigh. "That might be the reason why nobody
ever came to look for me. They say more people
were killed than any one knew about. If I
could only remember the very least thing that
happened before, but I can't; it's just as if I
came alive for the first time that day in the hospital.
Oh, here comes your aunt; I'll go and help
her with her chair." And dropping her towel
on the floor of the porch, Undine darted into the
house, whence she returned in a moment, carefully
guiding Miss Graham's wheeled chair over
the door-sill.</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear," Miss Graham said, kindly.
"You are a very helpful little girl, but when you
are as accustomed to me and my chair as Marjorie
is, you will realize that I can manage very
well. I heard your voices, and thought I would
come out here for a little while; it's so much
cooler than in the house."</p>

<p>"Won't you let me get your sewing, or your
book, or something?" inquired Undine, hovering
solicitously over the invalid.</p>

<p>"No, thank you. I have been sewing all the
afternoon; helping Mrs. Graham with the new
parlor curtains, and I'm going to be lazy for a
little while. I am afraid you dropped your own
sewing, in your anxiety to help me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Undine blushed as she stooped to pick up the
discarded towel.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm very careless," she said apologetically;
"Miss Brent said I was, but I love to
wait on people."</p>

<p>Miss Graham laughed, and she had such a
merry, contagious laugh that she was speedily
joined by Marjorie, and even Undine herself.</p>

<p>"It is very pleasant to be waited on," she said,
"and I am sure you would make a capital nurse,
Undine."</p>

<p>Undine looked pleased.</p>

<p>"I should like to be a nurse," she said. "I
used to do lots of things for Mr. Jackson, and he
liked to have me. I wish I could wait on you,
because then I should feel that I was of some
use, and that you weren't just keeping me because
you were sorry for me."</p>

<p>There was an unmistakable wistfulness in Undine's
tone, and Miss Graham was touched.</p>

<p>"My dear little girl," she said, "I am sure
there are many ways in which you can make
yourself useful if you stay with us. You will
soon learn to be a great help to Mrs. Graham, and
there will be many little things you can do for me
as well."</p>

<p>Marjorie gave her aunt a grateful glance, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Undine looked relieved. At that moment the
afternoon stillness was broken by a sound of distant
hoof-beats, and a clear tenor voice singing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'On the road to Mandalay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where the old flotilla lay.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"It's Jim coming with the mail," cried Marjorie
joyfully; "I should know his voice anywhere,
and that's his favorite song. Oh, I wonder
if there will be an answer to Father's letter
to Miss Brent. What's the matter, Undine?"</p>

<p>For Undine, who was still standing by Miss
Graham's chair, had suddenly grown pale, and a
strange, startled expression had come into her
face.</p>

<p>"Who's Jim?" she demanded sharply.</p>

<p>"Only one of Father's men. He used to be a
cow-puncher in Texas. I think you must have
seen him; he's about the ranch a good deal."</p>

<p>The hoof-beats were drawing nearer, and the
rider had begun another verse of his song.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Er petticoat was yaller,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">An' 'er little cap was green,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">An' 'er name was Supy Yawler,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Jes' the same as Thebaw's queen.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I know that song," cried Undine excitedly,
clasping and unclasping her hands, and she began
reciting in a dreamy, far-away voice:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"'An' I see 'er first a smokin'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Of a whackin' big sheroot,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">An' wastin' Christian kisses</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">On a 'eathen idol's foot.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Somebody used to sing it. Who was it? Oh,
tell me quick; I must remember, I must, I must!"</p>

<p>She turned imploringly to Miss Graham and
Marjorie, but the two blank, puzzled faces gave
her no help, and with a low cry, the poor child
covered her face with her hands, and began to
sob. Marjorie's kind arms were round her
friend in a moment, but it was no easy task to
stem the torrent of Undine's grief.</p>

<p>"Oh, help me to remember, please, please do
help me!" she wailed, between hysterical sobs
and gasps. "I almost remembered, and now it's
all gone again. Oh, what shall I do&mdash;what shall
I do?"</p>

<p>"You'll remember it all some time, dear, I
know you will," soothed Marjorie, crying herself
from pure sympathy. "Do try not to mind quite
so much, Undine. I know it must be terrible,
but we're all so sorry for you, and we'll try to
make you happy, indeed we will."</p>

<p>By this time horse and rider had reached the
ranch house, and Jim Hathaway, a freckled, red-haired
youth, had sprung to the ground, and was
regarding the scene in undisguised astonishment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you brought us any letters to-day,
Jim?" Miss Graham asked, by way of relieving
the situation.</p>

<p>"Yes'm; there's two for Mr. Graham, and
some newspapers, and a magazine."</p>

<p>"Ask him where he learned that song," whispered
Undine to Marjorie. She was still trembling,
and seemed very much agitated.</p>

<p>"Where did you learn that song you were
singing just now, Jim?" Marjorie inquired, eagerly;
"the one about the 'Road to Mandalay,'
you know?"</p>

<p>Jim looked rather vague.</p>

<p>"Blessed if I remember," he said. "I picked
it up somewhere, but I couldn't rightly say where
it was."</p>

<p>"Won't you please try to remember?" said
Undine, lifting her tear-stained face from Marjorie's
shoulder. "I want very much to know.
I am trying to remember something about it, and
if you could tell me where you learned it it might
help me."</p>

<p>Jim stared at her rather stupidly; then his face
brightened.</p>

<p>"I guess I do remember, now I come to think
of it," he said slowly. "It was in Texas.
There was an English chap there, who was forever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
singing it. I picked it up from him. There
were a lot of verses to it but I don't know 'em
all."</p>

<p>Undine shook her head hopelessly.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said; "I don't believe I was
ever in Texas." And without another word, she
turned and went into the house.</p>

<p>It was more than an hour later when Mrs.
Graham knocked softly at the door of the little
room which had been given to the strange guest.
She waited a moment, and then, receiving no answer,
turned the handle and went in. Undine
was lying on the bed, her face buried in the pillow.
She was so still that Mrs. Graham thought
she must be asleep, and was turning away again
when there was a slight movement on the bed,
and with a long sigh, the girl lifted her head.</p>

<p>At sight of her hostess, Undine sprang to her
feet, and began pushing the tumbled hair back
from her eyes. She was very white, and there
was a drawn, suffering look on her face, which
went to Mrs. Graham's motherly heart.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Undine, humbly.
"I'm afraid you must all think me very silly and
troublesome. I didn't mean to make a fuss, but
when I heard that boy singing 'Mandalay' it
seemed for just a minute as if I were going to remember<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
something, and then it was all gone
again. I thought that perhaps if I lay very still
with my eyes shut tight, and thought as hard as I
could, it might come again, but it didn't."</p>

<p>"Sit down, dear," said Mrs. Graham, kindly,
and seating herself on the edge of the bed, she
drew Undine down beside her. "Does your
head ache?"</p>

<p>"It aches dreadfully," confessed Undine,
pressing her hand to her forehead. "It always
does when I try very hard to remember."</p>

<p>"I was afraid so. It isn't good for you to try
to remember in this way; it won't help things at
all, and may make them much worse. You must
promise me not to try to think so hard again.
When your memory comes back it will come naturally,
and without any forcing. Now I want to
talk to you about something quite different. Mr.
Graham has had a letter from the 'Home For
The Friendless' at Oakland, and another from
your friend Miss Brent, or Mrs. Rogers, as I
believe she is now."</p>

<p>"What did they say?" inquired Undine, languidly.
She seemed too much exhausted to take
much interest in letters.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Rogers spoke kindly of you, and seemed
pleased to know where you are. Her sister had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
telegraphed her of your disappearance. She said
she hoped you would find a good home, for she
was afraid nothing would induce Mrs. Hicks to
take you back. They remembered you at the
'Home,' too, and are willing to have you there
again if we will pay your expenses back to California."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to go back there," protested
Undine, lifting her head, and speaking more like
her old self. "Oh, Mrs. Graham, must I go?
Can't I stay here? I'll do anything you want me
to, and I can work hard, just wait and see if I
can't."</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham smiled as she glanced at the soft
little hands, which did not look as though their
owner were capable of much hard work.</p>

<p>"That is just what we have been talking
about," she said. "I should be glad of a little
extra help in the house; Juanita isn't as young as
she once was, and I want to give Marjorie a little
more time for study. So if you think you would
really care to stay with us, and are willing to
work for small wages&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wages!" cried Undine indignantly; "I don't
want any money; I only want to stay with you,
and work for my board. You're all so kind, and
... and I think you must be more like the people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
I used to live with than Miss Brent and Mrs.
Hicks were. Oh, if I could only remember!"</p>

<p>"There, there, we won't talk any more about
remembering just now," interrupted Mrs. Graham
cheerfully. "You shall stay with us, at
least for the present, and who knows what may
happen in the future. Now lie down again, and
try to take a nap before supper. You look very
tired, and a good sleep will do your head more
good than anything else." And yielding to a
sudden impulse, Mrs. Graham stooped and kissed
the flushed face on the pillow, almost as tenderly
as if this strange, friendless little waif had been
her own Marjorie.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>A VISITOR FROM THE EAST</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Of</span> all the different kinds of housework, I
think pickling is the most disagreeable!"</p>

<p>Marjorie made this remark as she came into
her aunt's room one glorious October afternoon.
Miss Graham's room was the prettiest and most
luxurious in the ranch house. Every comfort
which limited income and inaccessible surroundings
could afford had been procured for the invalid,
and to Marjorie, after a hard day's work
of helping her mother and Juanita in the yearly
pickling, it seemed a very haven of rest and comfort.
Miss Graham herself, in a pretty pink
wrapper, was lying on the sofa, while Undine
read aloud to her. She was a very different Undine
from the pale, timid girl of two months before.
The thin cheeks had filled out wonderfully,
and the big brown eyes had almost entirely lost
their expression of frightened bewilderment, for
Undine had found her place in the household and
was happy. I have my doubts as to whether Undine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
would have proved of great use in the kitchen,
her knowledge of any kind of housework
being decidedly limited, but before she had been
in her new home a fortnight Miss Graham was
taken ill. It was not a serious illness, though a
tedious and painful one, and almost from the first
moment Undine had established herself as nurse.
Her devotion was touching; it was with difficulty
that she could be persuaded to leave the invalid's
bedside even for the necessary rest and exercise,
and she would gladly have worked night and day
in the service of gentle Miss Graham, who almost
unconsciously grew to love the girl, and to
depend upon her more than she would have believed
possible in so short a time.</p>

<p>Now Miss Graham was better, and the task of
nursing was almost at an end, but she was still
weak, and Mr. and Mrs. Graham were thankful
for the willing service of the girl whom they had
taken into their home on account of her friendless
condition and her big honest brown eyes.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you two people have
been spared to-day," continued Marjorie, throwing
herself wearily into the rocking-chair.
"Thank goodness, they're all done, and we shall
have pickles enough to last another year."</p>

<p>"We haven't been spared the smell," said Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Graham, laughing. "I really felt at one time to-day
that I would gladly forego pickles for the
rest of my life."</p>

<p>"What have you been reading?" Marjorie inquired,
with a glance at the book Undine had put
down on her entrance.</p>

<p>"'Lorna Doone.' We have had a delightful
afternoon. It is such a charming story, and Undine
reads aloud remarkably well."</p>

<p>Marjorie glanced out of the window, at the
brilliant autumn sunshine.</p>

<p>"I think I'll go for a ride, to get the smell of
the pickles out of my nostrils," she said.
"Mother says she won't need me any more to-day."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," said Miss Graham approvingly,
"and suppose you take Undine with
you? She has been indoors all day; the fresh
air will do her good."</p>

<p>"All right," assented Marjorie, well pleased.
"Come along, Undine," she added, rising; "we'll
have time for a good gallop before supper."</p>

<p>Undine hesitated.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you can spare me?" she asked,
with an anxious glance at the pale face on the pillow.</p>

<p>"Quite sure, dear. I shall not need anything,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and even if I should Mrs. Graham and Juanita
are both within call. So run along, you conscientious
little nurse, and enjoy yourself for the rest
of the afternoon."</p>

<p>Undine blushed with pleasure at the compliment,
and five minutes later she and Marjorie
were on their way to the stables.</p>

<p>It was one of those glorious autumn days, when
the air is like a tonic, and every object stands
out with almost startling clearness.</p>

<p>"The mountains look so near to-day, it seems
almost as if we might ride to them, doesn't it?"
remarked Undine, as the two girls trotted out of
the ranch gates on their ponies; Undine sitting as
straight, and riding with almost as much ease as
Marjorie herself.</p>

<p>"They are nearly a hundred miles away," said
Marjorie, with a glance in the direction of the
great snow-tipped mountains, which certainly did
look very near in that wonderful atmosphere.
"We could go there, though, if we had an automobile.
What wonderful things automobiles
must be."</p>

<p>"I suppose they are&mdash;there were plenty of
them in California&mdash;but nothing could be
half as nice as a gallop in this wonderful air. A
pony like this is worth all the automobiles in San<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Francisco." And Undine bestowed an affectionate
pat on the neck of the pretty brown horse she
was riding.</p>

<p>"I believe you love riding as much as I do,"
said Marjorie, sympathetically. "I wonder
where you learned to ride. I shall never forget
how astonished Father and I were that first
day, when we made you get on a pony just for
fun, and you took the reins, and started off as if
you had been accustomed to riding every day
of your life."</p>

<p>There was a trace of the old shadow in Undine's
face as she answered:</p>

<p>"It's all very strange, and I can't explain it,
but it seemed quite natural, and as if I had done
it often before. Even when the pony jumped,
and your father thought I would be frightened, I
wasn't. I seemed to know just what to do,
though I couldn't tell how I knew."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you lived on a ranch once," Marjorie
suggested. "That would explain it."</p>

<p>Undine shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," she said, "for when I first
came here it was all quite strange, and though
I'm not a bit afraid of horses, I'm horribly afraid
of cows. A girl who had lived long on a ranch
couldn't be afraid of cows, could she?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Marjorie assented, and the two girls rode on in
silence for several minutes. Then Undine spoke
again.</p>

<p>"There's another curious thing that I haven't
told you. That book I'm reading to your aunt&mdash;'Lorna
Doone,' you know&mdash;I'm sure I've read
it before. I know what is going to happen in
every chapter."</p>

<p>Marjorie looked much interested.</p>

<p>"Have you told Aunt Jessie about it?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"No, I was afraid it might bother her. I
don't think she or your mother like to have me
talk about the things I remember."</p>

<p>"That's only because they're afraid you will
worry and make yourself ill," Marjorie explained.
"You remember what a dreadful headache
you had the day you heard Jim singing
'Mandalay.' They're really tremendously interested."</p>

<p>"Are they?" said Undine, looking pleased.
"I was afraid they thought me silly. At first I
know they thought I was a fraud, and I'm sure I
don't blame them. How could any one believe
such a queer story? And yet it's all true, every
word."</p>

<p>"They believe it now, at any rate," said Marjorie,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
"and they're just as much interested as I
am. Mother says she can't help worrying when
she thinks of your friends, and how they may be
grieving for you."</p>

<p>"Miss Brent said she didn't believe I had any
friends or they would have come to look for me,"
said Undine sadly.</p>

<p>"But you must have belonged to somebody,"
persisted Marjorie, "and it isn't likely all your
family were killed in the earthquake, even if some
of them were. Then you do remember some
things&mdash;there was the person who sang 'Mandalay.'"</p>

<p>"But I can't remember who it was; I only
know there was somebody who used to sing it. I
almost remembered for a minute that day, but it
was gone in a flash, and it has never come back
since."</p>

<p>"Well, don't let's talk any more about worrying
things this glorious afternoon," broke in Marjorie,
noticing the troubled sound in her friend's
voice. "Let's have a good gallop, and forget
everything else. Come along, Roland."</p>

<p>Away flew Roland, admonished by a gentle
tap from his mistress, and he was followed closely
by Undine's pony. The next half hour was one
of unalloyed enjoyment to both girls. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
quick motion, the bright sunshine, the keen air, all
conspired to banish thoughts of care or perplexity
from Undine's mind, and to bring the bright
color into her cheeks. Marjorie, glancing over
her shoulder at her friend, suddenly realized what
a very pretty girl Undine was. Even the khaki
skirt and the sombrero, counterparts of Marjorie's
own, could not detract from her beauty,
and she sat on her pony with as much grace as
any lady in the land.</p>

<p>"There! wasn't that great?" exclaimed Marjorie,
drawing Roland in at last, and turning to
her friend, with sparkling eyes. "I don't believe
you ever had a finer gallop than that in your
life."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I ever did," agreed Undine,
straightening her sombrero, and pushing back the
tumbled hair from her eyes. "Must we go back
now?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so. Father and Mother don't
like to have me stay out after sunset. Look at
the mountains; they seem just as near as ever,
don't they? And yet we've been riding straight
away from them all the time."</p>

<p>"Isn't it still?" whispered Undine, with a deep
breath. "I feel as if I ought to whisper, though
I don't know why. I don't suppose there's another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
living soul within miles of us, and yet I'm
not the least bit afraid."</p>

<p>"There is, though," exclaimed Marjorie, in
sudden astonishment. "Look at that man.
Where can he be going?" And she pointed with
her whip-handle to a solitary figure, carrying a
suit-case, which was slowly advancing in their direction.
"He isn't an Indian or a Mexican,
either," she added eagerly; "he's a white man,
and he must be on his way to the ranch. Nobody
who isn't coming to the ranch ever takes
this road."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he's a tramp," suggested Undine
nervously. "We'd better hurry home."</p>

<p>But Marjorie scorned the suggestion.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," she said indignantly. "The idea
of wanting to run away! Besides, we can't;
he's making signs to us to wait for him. He
wants to speak to us."</p>

<p>Undine did not feel at all sure of the wisdom
of this proceeding, but there seemed nothing else
to do, and in a few moments the stranger, who
had quickened his pace at sight of the two girls,
was within speaking distance. He was plentifully
besprinkled with dust, and was looking decidedly
warm and tired, but his appearance and
manner were those of a gentleman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Excuse me for detaining you," he said, apologetically,
"but can you tell me how far I am
from Mr. Donald Graham's ranch?"</p>

<p>"I thought you must be coming to the ranch,"
said Marjorie, with a friendly smile; "it's about
five miles from here."</p>

<p>"Five miles," repeated the stranger in a tone
of dismay, and he set down the heavy suit-case
he was carrying, and wiped his forehead with his
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Have you been walking far?" Marjorie inquired
sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I must have walked at least five
miles already. My team broke down, one of the
wheels came off, and the man who was driving
me out to the ranch seemed to think the only
thing to be done was to leave the wagon with my
trunk on it by the roadside while he returned to
town on horseback, to get another trap. He advised
me to walk on, but I had no idea of the distance.
Will you please tell me if this is the
shortest way to the ranch?"</p>

<p>"It's the only way," said Marjorie, smiling,
and thinking that this tall, broad-shouldered man
must certainly be "a tenderfoot." Her own
father thought nothing of a ten-mile tramp over
the prairie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I suppose there is no help for it, but
five miles&mdash;are you sure it's as much as five
miles?"</p>

<p>Marjorie nodded; she was trying to think of
some way of helping the stranger out of his difficulty.
But it was finally he himself who put
into words the very suggestion she was going to
make.</p>

<p>"I wonder if by any chance you young ladies
happen to be going as far as the ranch," he said,
with a rather curious glance at the two figures,
sitting astride their ponies.</p>

<p>"We're going straight there now," said Marjorie,
eagerly, "and if you don't mind waiting,
I'll ask Father to send a horse for you."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, but do you think he could
possibly send a wagon as well? I am not much
of a horseman."</p>

<p>This certainly was a "tenderfoot," and no mistake,
but Marjorie was too polite to laugh.</p>

<p>"All right," she said, "I'll see about it, but
it will take longer to wait for a team to be
hitched up."</p>

<p>"That can't be helped. I'm afraid I'm not
equal to another five miles on foot. Do you know
Mr. Graham?"</p>

<p>Marjorie laughed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course I do," she said in her frank,
friendly way; "he's my father."</p>

<p>"Your father!" repeated the gentleman, his
face lighting up; "why, you don't mean to tell
me you are little Marjorie?"</p>

<p>"I'm Marjorie Graham, but I'm not very little.
I'm five feet, three, and I was fourteen last
March."</p>

<p>"Well, you were about two feet, three when
I last saw you," said the gentleman, smiling; "so
you must forgive me for not recognizing you at
once. Have you ever heard of your uncle Henry
Carleton?"</p>

<p>With a joyous exclamation, impulsive Marjorie
sprang from her pony and leaving the faithful
Roland to his own devices, rushed to her
uncle's side, holding out both hands.</p>

<p>"Of course I have!" she cried, lifting her
radiant face for the expected kiss. "Oh, Uncle
Henry, I'm so glad you've come to see us at last;
Mother will be so happy."</p>

<p>Although somewhat surprised by the warmth
of this greeting, Mr. Carleton was not at all displeased.
Indeed, he was smiling very pleasantly
by the time he had given his niece the kiss she
was evidently expecting, and his face softened as
he regarded her more attentively.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"I ought to have known you, Marjorie," he
said, "for you are very like your mother."</p>

<p>Marjorie flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>"I'm glad," she said; "I'd rather look like
Mother than any one else. Is Elsie with you?"</p>

<p>"Elsie? You know about my little girl, too,
then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed; I know she is just about my
age. Mother has a photograph of her, taken
when she was a baby, and I've always wished I
could see her. Having a cousin of one's own
age must be almost as good as having a sister.
Oh, I do hope she's coming to the ranch!"</p>

<p>Mr. Carleton shook his head.</p>

<p>"Elsie and her mother were with me, but they
have gone back to New York. We have been
through the Canadian Rockies and the Yosemite
together, and yesterday we stopped at the Grand
Canyon. Your aunt and cousin have gone on in
the train, but I thought I would like a few days
with your mother, so I got off at the nearest station
to the ranch, and was driving out. I suppose
I should have written, but I thought I would
rather enjoy giving your mother a surprise. I
hope I sha'n't be in the way."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, you won't," declared Marjorie
heartily. "Mother and Father will be delighted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and so will Aunt Jessie. We so seldom have
visitors, and it's such a treat, but I'm dreadfully
sorry Aunt Julia and Elsie aren't coming, too.
What a lucky girl Elsie is to have seen all those
wonderful places! Father is going to take
Mother and me to the Canyon some day when he
can afford it. But I was so glad to see you that
I forgot to introduce my friend. Undine, this
is my uncle, Mr. Carleton.</p>

<p>"Uncle Henry, this is my friend, Miss Undine&mdash;we
don't know her other name."</p>

<p>Undine&mdash;who had been watching proceedings
with interest&mdash;smiled shyly, and held out
her hand. She had also dismounted from her
pony, and was holding him by the bridle.</p>

<p>"Undine," repeated Mr. Carleton, looking
amused, as he took the girl's hand, and regarded
her curiously; "that is a rather unusual name,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>Undine blushed, and looked embarrassed, and
Marjorie hastened to explain.</p>

<p>"It isn't her real name, but she didn't like being
called Sally, so we thought we would call her
Undine until she remembers what her name is.
It's a very interesting story, Uncle Henry, but I
won't stop to tell it now, for it's getting late, and
I must hurry home as fast as I can, and have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Father send a team for you. I wish you could
ride my pony; I wouldn't mind walking the five
miles a bit."</p>

<p>"That's a nice little girl of Susie's," Mr.
Carleton remarked to himself, as the ponies and
their riders disappeared in a cloud of dust.
"She has her mother's eyes and friendly ways,
but&mdash;well, perhaps it was just as well I couldn't
persuade Julia to stop over at the ranch. I doubt
if Marjorie and Elsie would hit it off very well
together."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>UNCLE HENRY'S PROPOSITION</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Carleton</span> received a hearty welcome at
the ranch. Mr. and Mrs. Graham were not the
sort of people to remember old grievances; Mrs.
Graham was honestly glad to see her brother, and
they were both quite willing to let bygones be
bygones. So the visitor found the meeting with
his sister and her husband a much less embarrassing
one than he had expected, and the days at
the ranch passed so pleasantly that he was easily
persuaded to prolong his stay from a day or two
to a week, and then to a fortnight. He and his
sister had more than one long confidential talk,
and although no word of complaint was uttered,
Mr. Carleton was clever enough to read between
the lines, and it was after one of these talks that
he wrote a letter to his wife in New York, for an
answer to which he was anxiously waiting.</p>

<p>It was on an afternoon in the second week of
his visit that Mr. Carleton sauntered out on to
the porch, to find Marjorie alone, and busily engaged
in trimming a hat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where are all the others?" he inquired,
throwing himself rather wearily into the rocker
by her side. "I've been writing letters all the
afternoon, and haven't heard a sound in the
house."</p>

<p>"They are all out," said Marjorie. "Father
wanted Mother to see some colts he is thinking
of buying, and Aunt Jessie has gone with them,
for the sake of the drive. Undine has gone,
too."</p>

<p>"And how does it happen that you were left
behind, like Cinderella. Wasn't there room in
the wagon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I could have squeezed in, or else ridden
Roland, but I was too busy. I'm making a new
hat, and that's always a very absorbing occupation.
Don't you think it's going to be pretty?"
And Marjorie held up the plain straw hat,
trimmed with blue ribbon, for her uncle's inspection.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt it will be most becoming,"
said Mr. Carleton, smiling, "but have you done
it all yourself?"</p>

<p>"Of course I have. I've trimmed all my hats
since I was twelve. I make my shirt-waists,
too, all but the cutting out; Mother does that.
Doesn't Elsie make her own things?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I'm afraid she doesn't; sewing isn't exactly
in Elsie's line."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she likes other kinds of work better,"
said Marjorie, cheerfully. "I suppose
Aunt Julia is disappointed, though. Mother says
she would be very sorry if I didn't like to sew;
she thinks every girl should learn to make her
own clothes."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid your aunt isn't any more fond of
sewing than Elsie is," said Mr. Carleton, with a
rather peculiar smile.</p>

<p>Marjorie secretly wondered who made Elsie's
dresses, and who attended to the household mending,
but fearing it might be impolite to ask,
changed the subject by saying:</p>

<p>"Undine could scarcely sew at all when she
came, but Aunt Jessie has been teaching her, and
she has improved very much. Don't you think
it's tremendously interesting about Undine, Uncle
Henry?"</p>

<p>"It is certainly a most unusual case," admitted
Mr. Carleton. "I was at first inclined to believe
that Miss Undine was gifted with a vivid
imagination, and was imposing on you all, but
your father and mother believe her story."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed, we all believe it," cried Marjorie,
eagerly. "We know it's true, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Father wrote to the dressmaker where Undine
worked for two years, and she said everything
was just as Undine had told us."</p>

<p>"Well, it is certainly a case for a brain specialist,"
said Mr. Carleton, "but unfortunately
there are no specialists of any kind in this part
of the world. I wish there were, for your aunt
Jessie's sake."</p>

<p>Marjorie's bright face was suddenly clouded.</p>

<p>"You don't think Aunt Jessie ill, do you?"
she asked, anxiously. "She seems so much better
than she was two weeks ago."</p>

<p>"I don't know that she is worse than usual,
but she is a very different creature from the
strong, active girl I remember. Poor child, she
has had a terrible experience; I wish some good
surgeon could see her."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;oh, Uncle Henry, you mean
you think a surgeon might possibly be able to
help her!" Marjorie's hat had fallen into her
lap, and she was regarding her uncle with eager,
troubled eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether a surgeon could help
her or not, but he could at least make an examination.
I don't suppose there is even an ordinary
physician in this neighborhood."</p>

<p>"There is one at Lorton, but that's twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
miles away, and I've heard people say he wasn't
very good. Father sent for a surgeon from Albuquerque
when Aunt Jessie was hurt, and he
said it was her spine that had been injured, and
that she could never be cured. Do you think a
doctor from the East might say something different?"</p>

<p>"My dear child, don't get so excited. I
really have not the slightest idea; I was only
speculating on my own account. It seems such
a pity that one so young&mdash;well, well, it can't be
helped, I suppose, and there is no use in talking
about it."</p>

<p>Marjorie sighed as she took up her work
again, and they were both silent for several minutes.
Then Marjorie spoke again, and her voice
was not quite steady.</p>

<p>"If I thought there was any surgeon in the
world who could cure Aunt Jessie, I believe I
would go and find him myself, and bring him
here, if it took me years to earn the money, and I
had to work day and night to do it. She's the
dearest, bravest&mdash;oh, Uncle Henry, you haven't
any idea what Aunt Jessie is!"</p>

<p>Marjorie broke off, with a half-suppressed sob,
and dashed away some tears, which would come
in spite of a brave effort to keep them back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Mr. Carleton's face softened as he watched her;
he had grown to have a high opinion of this
niece of his. He could not help wondering
rather sadly whether there were any one in the
world of whom his own little daughter would
have spoken in such glowing terms.</p>

<p>"You're a loyal little soul, Marjorie," he said
kindly. "I wish Elsie had you for a friend."</p>

<p>Marjorie smiled through her tears.</p>

<p>"I wish I had her for my friend," she said.
"Don't you think she would like to come out
here and make us a visit some time? She might
find it rather hot in summer, if she wasn't accustomed
to it, but the winters are beautiful."</p>

<p>"Elsie has her school in winter," Mr. Carleton
said, "but perhaps she may come some day.
Hark, who is that singing?"</p>

<p>"Only Jim coming with the mail. He always
sings when he rides. It's generally 'Mandalay,'
but it's 'Loch Lomond' to-day."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'Oh, you'll tak' the high road, and I'll tak' the low road,'"</p></div>

<p>sang the clear tenor voice, and Jim Hathaway,
on his big brown horse, came galloping up to
the door.</p>

<p>"There's only one letter for you to-day, Uncle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Henry," announced Marjorie, taking the handful
of letters and papers from the boy. "It's
a big fat one, though. Perhaps it's from Elsie;
you haven't had one letter from Elsie since you
came."</p>

<p>"It is from your Aunt Julia," said Mr. Carleton,
and immediately proceeded to make himself
acquainted with its contents, while Jim galloped
away to the stables, and Marjorie went on with
her hat trimming.</p>

<p>It was, as Marjorie had said, a "fat letter,"
and it took Mr. Carleton some time to read it.
Indeed, he read some parts over more than once,
before he finally put it in his pocket, and prepared
to light a cigar. "Are Aunt Julia and
Elsie well?" Marjorie inquired, politely. She
could not help wondering why this aunt and
cousin never sent any messages to her.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they are very well, thank you.
Your aunt says it has been rather warm for the
season, and there hasn't been much going on."</p>

<p>Mr. Carleton relapsed into silence, and Marjorie
said no more. Her thoughts were filled by
a new idea. What if a surgeon could really be
found who would be able to cure Aunt Jessie?
Such a possibility seemed almost too wonderful
to be contemplated, and yet,&mdash;and yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The whistle of a distant train broke the stillness,
and Marjorie came down from her air castle
to remark&mdash;</p>

<p>"There goes the East Bound; two hours late
to-day."</p>

<p>"You seem as much interested in the hours of
trains as if you were in the habit of traveling on
one at least once a week," said Mr. Carleton,
smiling. "How would you like to take a journey&mdash;to
go to New York, for instance?"</p>

<p>"I should love it better than anything in the
world," said Marjorie frankly.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps it can be managed. What
would you say to going East with me next week,
and spending the winter in New York?"</p>

<p>For the second time the hat Marjorie was
trimming rolled unheeded into her lap, while she
sat staring at her uncle with startled, wondering
eyes. The proposal was so sudden&mdash;so undreamed
of&mdash;that for the first moment she was
speechless, and when words did come at last,
they were only:</p>

<p>"You mean to spend the winter with you and
Aunt Julia?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and to go to school with Elsie. I think
your father and mother are rather anxious about
your education."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know they are," said Marjorie, eagerly.
"They wanted to send me to school at Albuquerque
this autumn, but the drought spoiled
the alfalfa crop, and there was disease among the
cattle, so Father didn't feel he could afford it. I
should love to see New York more than anything
I can think of, but to go so far away from them
all for a whole winter&mdash;oh, Uncle Henry, you're
very kind to suggest it, but I really don't believe
I could."</p>

<p>"Not if you knew your father and mother
wished it very much, and that it would be a great
relief to their minds?" Mr. Carleton spoke
rather gravely, and Marjorie felt suddenly embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Of course I would try to do what they
wanted me to," she said meekly, "but I don't believe
they would be willing to have me go as far
away from them. Albuquerque was different; I
could have come home for the vacations from
there. It's awfully good of you, Uncle Henry,
and I would love to see Aunt Julia and Elsie, but
New York is so far away."</p>

<p>"Only three days by train," said Mr. Carleton,
smiling; "that ought not to seem much to
you Westerners. You would find the life very
different from that to which you have been accustomed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
but I think you would enjoy it, and
you must have an education, you know."</p>

<p>Marjorie blushed, and her eyes drooped.</p>

<p>"I want it very much," she said humbly. "If
I were well educated, I might be able to teach,
and to help Father and Mother in other ways.
Uncle Henry, do you think it is my duty to go to
New York?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Marjorie, I do," said her uncle, with
unusual gravity. "I think it is an opportunity
that you should not miss. I have written your
Aunt Julia about it, and her answer has just
come. She agrees with me that it will be the
best thing for you. Your home will be with us,
of course, and you will go to school with Elsie.
It is not a large school, only a class of a dozen
girls, and the teacher is a charming woman.
You will soon make friends, and I think you
would be happy."</p>

<p>"And I would be with Elsie," said Marjorie,
beginning to look on the bright side, as she generally
did. "It would be lovely to know my own
cousin. Have you spoken to Mother about it,
Uncle Henry?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, but I intend doing so this evening.
I have been waiting for your aunt's reply to my
letter. I feel quite sure your mother will consent;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
she is too sensible a woman to do anything
else. But it will be hard for her to let you go
so far away, and I want you to be a brave, sensible
girl, and not make it any harder than you
can help."</p>

<p>For a moment Marjorie was silent, and her
uncle could see by her face something of the
struggling that was going on within. Then she
spoke, and her voice was clear and brave.</p>

<p>"All right, Uncle Henry, I promise. If
Father and Mother want me to go I will, and I'll
try not to let them see how hard it is. After
all, it won't be like going to stay with strangers,
for I shall be with my own relations all the time,
and it will be so nice to have a cousin of my own
age. Here comes the wagon, so we can't talk
any more now. Oh, Uncle Henry, there's just
one question I want to ask. Are there many
good surgeons in New York?"</p>

<p>"Plenty of them," said her uncle, smiling.
"Don't say anything of what we have been talking
about, Marjorie, until I have a chance to explain
to your mother."</p>

<p>"No, I won't, and, Uncle Henry, please don't
think me ungrateful because I couldn't be so glad
just at first. It's beautiful of you and Aunt
Julia to want me, and if I go I'll try not to give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
any more trouble than I can possibly help. Now
I am going to my room for a few minutes. I
don't want Aunt Jessie to see me till I've got my
face straightened out. She knows me so well
she says she can tell the moment there is anything
the matter."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>THE LAST EVENING</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was settled. Marjorie was to go East with
her uncle, and spend the winter in New York.
Mr. Carleton felt that he could not leave his
business much longer, and was anxious to start
as soon as Marjorie could be ready. For a week
Mrs. Graham and Miss Jessie had sewed as they
had never sewed before, and Marjorie and even
Undine had worked so hard that there had been
little time to think of anything else. Now it was
the last evening, and the small leather trunk containing
all Marjorie's simple possessions, stood
packed, and ready to be taken early next
morning, to the railway station twenty miles
away.</p>

<p>Mr. Carleton had been somewhat puzzled by
all these elaborate preparations, and had ventured
a gentle remonstrance to his sister.</p>

<p>"Why take so much trouble, Susie? Julia
will get the child everything she needs, and I'll
attend to the bills. You needn't worry about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Marjorie's being well-dressed; you know Julia
has excellent taste."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Graham was resolute. She knew
well that her own ideas of dress and those of her
New York sister-in-law were very different, but
she was not without her share of family pride,
and was not willing that Marjorie should appear
before her Eastern relatives in clothes unfit for
her position. But alas! It was twelve years
since Mrs. Graham had left her New York home,
and styles change a good deal in twelve years.</p>

<p>Every one had kept up bravely during that
busy week, and they had all been extremely
cheerful. Marjorie never knew of the bitter
tears shed by mother and aunt in the solitude of
their own rooms, and Mrs. Graham's heart would
have ached even more than it did had she known
of the hours Marjorie lay awake, her head buried
deep in the pillow, so that Aunt Jessie in the next
room, should not hear her crying. Every one
knew it was for the best. Even Marjorie, miserable
as she was sometimes at the thought of
the two thousand miles which must soon lie between
herself and the people she loved best,
would have been keenly disappointed if Uncle
Henry had suddenly changed his mind, or Aunt
Julia written that it would not be convenient to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
have her. All through that last day she had
worked hard, trying not to think about to-morrow,
but now everything was done and everybody was
resting after their labors. Marjorie had sat on
the porch for an hour with her mother and aunt,
and they had all tried to talk cheerfully as usual,
but it was of no use. There was a dreadful inclination
on all their parts to drop into long silences,
which nobody seemed able to break.
They were alone, for Mr. Carleton and his
brother-in-law had gone for a walk, and Undine
was helping Juanita in the kitchen.</p>

<p>At last, at the end of a longer silence than
usual, Marjorie, feeling sure she shouldn't be
able to hold out much longer, suddenly sprang up,
explaining hurriedly:</p>

<p>"I'll be right back; I'm just going to the
stables for a moment to say good-by to Roland."
And she was off across the lawn, biting her lip
to keep back the sobs that must not come until
she was out of sight and hearing of her dear
ones.</p>

<p>The bidding good-by to her pony was a rather
lengthy proceeding. She was alone, for the men
had all gone off to their suppers, so she had her
cry out on Roland's neck, and whispered her last
loving instructions into his faithful ears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are to be a good pony, Roland, and do
just as you are told till I come home. Undine is
to ride you whenever she likes, and Aunt Jessie
thinks riding is so good for her that she's going
to try to let her go out for an hour every day.
You will miss me, I know, Roland dear, and I
shall miss you terribly, but I've got to have an
education, and after all one winter isn't so very
long to be away."</p>

<p>Whether Roland understood or not I cannot
pretend to say, but he rubbed his soft nose
against Marjorie's cheek, and snuggled up close
to her as if he loved her, and she left the stable
feeling somehow cheered and comforted.</p>

<p>On the way back she passed the old playhouse,
and could not resist the temptation of going in
for one more last good-bye, although she knew
it would mean another fit of crying. The sight
of the old toys and picture books&mdash;relics of the
childhood that would never come back&mdash;affected
her even more than the parting with Roland had
done, and sinking down on the bench where she
had dozed on the afternoon of Undine's arrival,
she gave herself up to a few minutes of quiet,
undisturbed grief.</p>

<p>She had just dried her eyes, and was wondering
if she could manage to reach her own room,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and wash her face, without being seen by any of
her family, when the door, which had been partly
closed, was pushed gently open, and Undine came
in.</p>

<p>At sight of her friend, Undine drew back,
blushing.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were here," she said,
apologetically; "I'll go away if you want to be
alone."</p>

<p>"Come in," said Marjorie, making room for
her on the bench. "Were you looking for
me?"</p>

<p>Undine's eyes drooped, and the color deepened
in her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I came to cry," she said simply.</p>

<p>"To cry?" repeated Marjorie in surprise;
"what did you want to cry for?"</p>

<p>"Because you're going away," Undine confessed,
nestling closer to her friend.</p>

<p>Marjorie slipped an arm round her. "I didn't
know you cared so much," she said. "You'll
have Aunt Jessie, and you're so fond of her."</p>

<p>"I shall miss you dreadfully," whispered Undine
tremulously. "You've been so good to me,
and&mdash;and you were the first one to believe in me.
All the rest thought I was telling stories, even
Miss Jessie."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"I couldn't help believing you," said Marjorie,
laughing. "When you looked at me with
those big eyes of yours, and told me all those
strange things, I felt sure they were true, though
it was the queerest story I had ever heard. I
think I should have to believe every word you
ever told me."</p>

<p>Undine smiled.</p>

<p>"I don't think your uncle believes it all even
yet," she said. "He looks at me so queerly
sometimes that it makes me uncomfortable. I
wish you were not going away with him."</p>

<p>"Oh, he is very kind," said Marjorie, loyally.
"It's so good of him to be willing to take
me to New York, and send me to school for the
whole winter. I'm sorry you don't like him, Undine."</p>

<p>"Well, he may be kind, but he isn't nearly as
nice as your father and mother. How do you
know you are going to like New York?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sure I shall like it, as soon as I
get used to things there." Marjorie spoke with
forced cheerfulness and choked down a rising
lump in her throat. "You see, it isn't
like going to live among strangers," she went
on, as much for the sake of reassuring herself
as her friend. "I shall be with my own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
uncle and aunt, and then there will be Elsie."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you won't like Elsie; you've never
seen her."</p>

<p>"Why, of course I shall like her. She's my
own cousin, and only three months older than
I am. I have always thought that having a
cousin was the next best thing to having a
sister."</p>

<p>"I wonder if I ever had a sister," Undine remarked
irrelevantly. "Somehow I don't believe
I had, for when I say the word 'sister' it never
makes my heart beat the way it does when I
say 'Mother.' I know I had a mother, and I
think I must have loved her very much."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that's because you've grown to love
my mother," Marjorie suggested; "she may remind
you of yours."</p>

<p>Undine pressed her hand to her forehead, and
the old bewildered look came back into her
eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, with a sigh; "I
don't know anything. Oh, Marjorie, do you
think I shall ever remember?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure you will," said Marjorie confidently,
"and so is Aunt Jessie. She says she's
sure when you get well and strong it will make a
great difference, and that's why she wants you to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
be out in the air as much as possible. You are
ever so much better now than when you came,
and when you are better still, and have left off
worrying, you'll wake up some morning remembering
everything; just wait and see if you
don't."</p>

<p>Undine smiled, but the smile was rather sad.</p>

<p>"I try not to worry," she said, "and I'm happier
here than I ever was before, but I'm so
frightened even now when I stop to think about
it all." Undine's sentence ended with an involuntary
shudder.</p>

<p>"Look here, Undine," said Marjorie, with a
sudden determination, "I'm going to let you in
to a great secret. You must promise not to
speak to any one about it, even Mother, for if
it should never come to anything it would be such
a dreadful disappointment to everybody."</p>

<p>"I won't tell," promised Undine, beginning to
look interested.</p>

<p>"It's about Aunt Jessie. Uncle Henry was
speaking of Aunt Jessie one day, and he thinks
it such a pity a good surgeon couldn't see her.
He says she might be helped a great deal.
There are no good surgeons here, but Uncle
Henry says there are a great many in New York,
and I've been thinking&mdash;oh, Undine, I'm almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
afraid to say it, it seems so presumptuous&mdash;but
just suppose I should meet a surgeon in New
York, and be able to persuade him to come here
to see Aunt Jessie, and suppose he should cure
her! It's the one hope that keeps me up every
time I feel like breaking down at the idea of going
so far away from everybody."</p>

<p>"It would be perfectly beautiful," Undine
agreed warmly, "but do you suppose any surgeon
would be willing to come so far to see some
one he didn't know?"</p>

<p>Marjorie's face, which had brightened for a
moment, grew very serious again.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said. "If he knew her
I'm sure he would come&mdash;any one would&mdash;but
if he had never even heard of her existence it
would be different, of course. I don't know how
I'm going to manage it; I only know it's the
thing I want most in the whole world, and I'm
going to try for it with all my might."</p>

<p>There was a ring in Marjorie's voice, and a
light in her eyes, which impressed her friend,
and with a quick, affectionate impulse, Undine
caught her hand and squeezed it.</p>

<p>"I wish I could help," she said, "but there
isn't anything I can do except pray about it. I
will pray every night, just as hard as I do to remember,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and if it really should happen I think I
should be almost as happy as you."</p>

<p>Just then the conversation was interrupted by
the sound of approaching footsteps and voices,
and with a whispered caution to Undine not to
breathe a word to any one, Marjorie hurried
away to join her father and uncle, who were returning
from their walk.</p>

<p>Everybody made a great effort to be cheerful
at supper that evening. Even Mr. Carleton,
who was usually rather quiet, threw himself
manfully into the breach, and told funny stories
that made them all laugh. After all, the evening
wasn't as dreadful as Marjorie had feared
it was going to be, but when bedtime came, and
she had to say good-night to her family for the
last time for eight whole months, she felt herself
in immediate danger of breaking down.</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham sat for a long time by her daughter's
bedside that night, and they had what Marjorie
called "a perfectly Heavenly talk." It
was a serious talk, but not a sad one, and when it
was over, and Marjorie flung her arms round
her mother's neck, and did break down just a
little, things did not seem nearly as hopeless as
she had expected.</p>

<p>"I don't believe any other girl in the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
has such a perfect mother as I have," was Marjorie's
last waking thought. "I don't deserve
her, and never can, but I'm going to try not to
disappoint her any more than I can possibly
help. One winter can't last for ever, and when
June comes, and I am at home again, how gloriously
happy we shall all be!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>MARJORIE WRITES LETTERS</h3>


<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'>

"October 28th, 19&mdash;<br />
</div>

"<span class="smcap">My Own Precious Mother</span>:

<p>"The first letter must be to you, of course,
and the next to Aunt Jessie. Uncle Henry says
if I write now I can post my letter when we stop
at Albuquerque this afternoon. Oh, Mother
darling, was it only this morning that I said
good-bye to you all? It seems as if I had been
away a month already.</p>

<p>"I am writing this at the desk in the library
car, and the train shakes so I am afraid my
writing will be worse than ever. Uncle Henry
says I shall soon get accustomed to the motion,
but just now it makes my head ache, and the car
feels very hot and stuffy. I opened the window,
but a great many cinders came in, and a lady in
the section next to mine asked me to close it
again, so I had to.</p>

<p>"I hope Father didn't tell you what a goose I
was at the station. I didn't mean to cry so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
much, but when I thought of you and Aunt Jessie
waving good-bye to me from the porch, with
such a sorrowful look on both your dear faces,
I just couldn't help it. I am going to cheer up
right away, though, so please don't worry about
me.</p>

<p>"It really was very exciting when the train
stopped at Lorton, and Uncle Henry and I got
in. When it began to move, and I realized that
I was actually on board, I gave a kind of gasp,
and would have liked to scream, if I hadn't been
afraid of shocking Uncle Henry. There are
not many people on the train, the colored porter
says, and Uncle Henry and I both have sections
to ourselves. I thought there would be regular
beds to sleep in, but there are not. The porter
says they turn the seats into beds at night, and
there are curtains to let down. I should think
it would be very uncomfortable sleeping so close
to other people, but I suppose one gets used to it
when one has traveled a good deal. Uncle
Henry says Aunt Julia won't travel unless she
has a stateroom, but he doesn't object to the sections.
I looked into the stateroom in this car,
but it didn't look very different from the sections,
except that it was larger and there was a
place to wash.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"We had lunch at a little table in the dining-car.
It was delicious but my head ached a little,
and I wasn't very hungry. Uncle Henry
talked politics with a gentleman who sat at the
same table with us, but they didn't say much to
me, so I looked out of the window, and it was all
very interesting. We are in Mexico now, and
to-morrow we shall be in Kansas. Kansas
makes me think of Undine and Mrs. Hicks. Oh,
how I do wonder if Undine will ever remember!</p>

<p>"Uncle Henry says we shall be in Albuquerque
in a few minutes, so I must stop writing
if I want to post my letter there. Good-night,
Mother darling; I will write again to-morrow,
and indeed, indeed, I will try to remember all the
things you said to me last night, and to be always</p>

<div class='right'><br /><br />
"October 28th.<br />
</div>

"<span class="smcap">Darling Aunt Jessie</span>:

<p>"I have been a whole night on the train, and
when I think of how far away from home we
are, I can't help being just a little frightened,
though it is all very interesting. I posted
Mother's letter at Albuquerque, where the train
stopped half an hour. Uncle Henry and I got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
out and walked up and down the platform, and,
oh, it was good to get a breath of fresh air! I
really didn't know that any place could be quite
so stuffy as this train. Everybody seems afraid
to have the windows open on account of the cinders,
but I think I should prefer even cinders to
stuffiness. There were some Indians selling
blankets and baskets, and a good many people
bought things. They crowded round us, and
made a good deal of fuss, and I heard one lady
say she was afraid of them. Just think of being
afraid of poor harmless Indians! I would have
liked to tell her how foolish she was, but was
afraid Uncle Henry might be displeased. I don't
think he is a very friendly person, for he hardly
speaks to any of the passengers on the train, and
last night he told me I talked too much to the
black porter, who was making up the sections.
Oh, Aunt Jessie, it was so curious to see him
turning all the seats into beds, but you have been
on a sleeping car, and know all about it.</p>

<p>"We had a very good dinner, which I enjoyed
more than lunch, because my head was better,
and in the evening we sat on the platform of the
observation car, and it was very pleasant. Uncle
Henry was kind, and talked to me a good deal&mdash;at
least it was a good deal for him. I asked him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
if he wasn't very anxious to get home to see
Aunt Julia and Elsie, and he said of course he
should be glad to see them, but didn't seem
nearly as excited as I am sure Father would be
about seeing us if he had been away from us
for three whole weeks. I think Elsie must be
very busy, for besides going to school, she has
music and German lessons in the afternoons, and
goes to a dancing class. Uncle Henry said he
hoped she and I would be good friends, and I
told him I was quite sure we should. Imagine a
girl not being good friends with her own first
cousin! Did you know we are to live in a hotel
all winter? Uncle Henry has a house on Madison
Avenue, but Aunt Julia is tired of housekeeping,
so he has rented it, and taken rooms in a
hotel instead. Uncle Henry calls the rooms an
apartment, and the name of the hotel is the
'Plaza.' It is on Fifth Avenue, and right opposite
the park, which must be very pretty. I
should think it would seem very queer to live in
a house with a lot of other people, but then the
people who live in hotels must have a great many
friends.</p>

<p>"At about nine o'clock Uncle Henry said he
was sleepy, so we went back to our car, and that
was when I talked to the porter while he made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
up the beds. I thought at first that I should
never be able to sleep; the train shook so, and we
were going so fast. It was hard work undressing
behind the curtain, but I managed somehow,
and even had a wash, though I had to hold on to
the side of the car with one hand while I washed
my face with the other. I did cry a little after
I was in bed, but I don't think any one heard.
It was my very first night away from home, you
know, Aunt Jessie dear, but I tried to remember
all the lovely, comforting things you and Mother
said to me, and I think I must have been pretty
tired, for before I realized I was getting sleepy
I was sound asleep, and I never opened my eyes
till it was broad daylight.</p>

<p>"To-day we are in Kansas, and it is very flat,
and not at all pretty. Uncle Henry says we
won't have any more fine scenery till we get to
the Hudson. The train seems stuffier than ever,
and I am just pining for fresh air and exercise.
We sat on the observation platform for a while
this morning, but Uncle Henry didn't like the
cinders, and wouldn't let me stay there by myself,
so we came back to our car. I don't think
traveling on a train is quite as pleasant as I
thought it was going to be. I am sure I should
like an automobile better. We saw automobiles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
at Topeka, where we stopped for ten minutes
this morning, and they looked very queer, going
all by themselves, without any horses, but I think
I should like a ride in one. Uncle Henry says
Aunt Julia is afraid of automobiles, so she still
uses a carriage.</p>

<p>"I talked to some people in the observation
car&mdash;a lady and a little boy, who are going to
Chicago&mdash;but I think most of the passengers
on this train are rather unsociable. They don't
talk much to each other but just read magazines
and newspapers when they are awake, and take
naps about every hour. I have watched the two
ladies in the section opposite mine, and they have
been asleep at least four times to-day. I heard
one of them say she never could sleep on a train;
wasn't that funny?</p>

<p>"We can post letters from Kansas City,
where we are due at half past eight to-night, so I
can send this on from there. We get to Chicago
to-morrow morning, and have three hours
there; won't that be exciting? Oh, I do hope
Uncle Henry will take me for a good long walk!
I feel as if I could tramp ten miles.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, you precious Auntie! I send a
thousand hugs and kisses to everybody. Tell
Undine not to forget Roland's sugar&mdash;he always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
has three lumps&mdash;and to be sure the kittens
in the barn have their milk every night and
morning. I am afraid I forgot to tell her about
the kittens; there were so many other things to
think of. I am so glad you and Mother have
Undine; she is such a dear, and I know will try
to take my place. I will write to Father and
Mother after I have been in Chicago.</p>

</div>

"<span class="smcap">My Own Precious Father and Mother</span>:

<p>"This letter is for you both, and Aunt Jessie
must have a share in it, too, because it is the last
I shall be able to write on the train.</p>

<p>"I didn't write at all yesterday, it was such an
exciting day! We got to Chicago at about noon,
and, oh, what a big, noisy, wonderful place it is!
I know I could never describe it if I tried for a
week, so I will just tell you what we did. It
was raining, which was a great disappointment
to me, but Uncle Henry didn't seem to mind.
He said we would take a taxi and go to the
'Blackstone' for lunch. I had no idea what a
taxi was, but didn't like to ask and when Uncle
Henry called one what do you suppose it was?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
One of those wonderful automobiles! I was a
tiny bit scared when we first got in, but when we
started, and went rushing through those crowded,
noisy streets, I just loved it.</p>

<p>"It didn't take us long to get to the 'Blackstone,'
which is an enormous hotel, looking out
on the lake. The lake is wonderful; I never saw
so much water before, and though the fog was
thick, and we couldn't see very far, I should have
liked to stand and look at it for a long time, but
Uncle Henry said we must hurry. I never saw
such a wonderful place as the dining-room at the
'Blackstone.' There were quantities of little
tables, and men waiters to bring you what you
wanted. I thought the bill of fare on the train
was long enough to satisfy any one, but the one
at the 'Blackstone' was simply endless. Uncle
Henry told me to choose what I wanted, but
there were so many things I couldn't possibly
choose, so he ordered a nice lunch, and all the
time we were eating music was playing in a gallery
overhead.</p>

<p>"After lunch Uncle Henry took another taxi,
and told the driver to show us the city. It was
all very interesting, but so noisy and confusing
that I got very tired looking at so many things
at once, and I was really rather glad when Uncle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Henry said it was time to go back to the station.</p>

<p>"This train is called the 'Chicago Special,'
and is even grander than the one we were on
before. It goes very fast, but doesn't swing so
much, because the road-bed is smoother, Uncle
Henry says. I was so tired last night that I
went to bed right after dinner, and never woke
once till morning. We are due in New York
this afternoon, and Uncle Henry says I had better
post my letter in Albany, because after we
leave there he wants me to see the Hudson, which
I believe is very beautiful. So good-bye, you
dear precious people! Oh, how anxious I am
for my first letters from home! Don't forget to
tell me about every single little thing that happens.
I am thinking of you all every minute,
and if I were going to any other people but Aunt
Julia and Elsie I would be so unhappy. But of
course going to one's own aunt and cousin is
very different from being with strangers, and
Uncle Henry is really very kind. Oh, I do wonder
if Elsie is as much excited about meeting me
as I am about meeting her!</p>

<p>"Uncle Henry says we shall be in Albany in ten
minutes, so good-bye again, with oceans of love

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>AUNT JULIA AND ELSIE</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Elsie</span>, my dear child, do you know what
time it is? Nearly half past five, and you haven't
started to dress. Your father will be so annoyed
if you are not ready when he arrives."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton, a small, fair woman, with a
rather worried, fretful expression, paused in the
doorway of her daughter's room, and regarded
the delinquent with anxiety not unmixed with dismay.
Elsie, arrayed in a pink kimono, was lying
comfortably on the sofa, deep in the pages of
an interesting story-book. At her mother's
words she threw down her book, and rose with a
yawn. She was a tall girl with dark eyes and
hair, and she would have been decidedly pretty
if she too had not looked rather cross.</p>

<p>"Is it really so late?" she said, indifferently.
"Why didn't Hortense call me? I had no idea
what time it was."</p>

<p>"But you ought to have known, dear," Mrs.
Carleton protested gently. "I don't suppose
Hortense knew you wanted to be called, but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
will ring for her at once. You will hurry, won't
you, darling? What excuse can I possibly make
to your father if he asks for you and finds you
are not ready?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry, Mamma. You know papa
only scolds because he thinks it his duty; he
doesn't really care. Besides, the train will probably
be late; those Western trains always are."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton rang the bell for the maid,
whose room was in a different part of the hotel,
and went to the closet in quest of her daughter's
evening dress.</p>

<p>"I will help you till Hortense comes," she
said. "You really must hurry, Elsie. It is not
as if your father were coming alone; he will expect
you to be ready to greet Marjorie."</p>

<p>Elsie shrugged her shoulders indifferently.</p>

<p>"As if a girl who has been living on a cattle
ranch in Arizona would care whether I were
dressed or not," she said. "Probably where she
comes from people wear kimonos all day long,
and never even heard of dressing for the evening."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton sighed, and the worried expression
deepened in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I really wish, darling, that you would try to
be a little more gracious about this. Of course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
it is a trial, but your father has made up his
mind that Marjorie shall spend the winter with
us, and it isn't going to make things any
pleasanter to be constantly finding fault about
them."</p>

<p>"I wasn't finding fault," retorted Elsie, who
had by this time taken off the kimono, and begun
brushing out her long hair. "I only said Marjorie
Graham wouldn't care a fig what I had on,
and I don't believe she will. I don't intend to be
disagreeable to her, but you know what an awful
nuisance it's going to be, and how I hate it.
Think of having to take her about everywhere
with me, and introduce her to all my friends."</p>

<p>"My dear, she is your own first cousin. Besides,
I am sure she is a nice child&mdash;your father
speaks so affectionately of her in his letters&mdash;and
her mother is a lovely woman. I was very
fond of her when we were girls together."</p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say she is all right," Elsie admitted
grudgingly, "but that doesn't alter the
fact of its being an awful bother to have her
here for a whole winter. You know how papa
fusses. He will be sure to get some idea in his
head about my not paying Marjorie enough attention,
and he will expect me to take her everywhere.
Oh, I hate it, I just hate it!" And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Elsie's voice actually trembled with vexation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton sighed again.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, dear," she began, but the
entrance of the maid at this moment, put an end
to the conversation, and she left the room, with
a final admonition to her daughter to hurry as
much as possible.</p>

<p>But alas! it was too late for hurrying. Mrs.
Carleton had only just entered the drawing-room,
when she heard a key turned in the outer door of
the apartment, followed by the sound of a familiar
voice calling cheerfully&mdash;</p>

<p>"Julia, Elsie, where are you? Here we are,
safe and sound!"</p>

<p>With a rapidly beating heart Mrs. Carleton
hurried forward to greet her husband and his
niece.</p>

<p>"My dear Henry, your train must have been
just on time," she exclaimed rather nervously.
"We had scarcely begun to expect you yet.
And so this is Marjorie. I am very glad to see
you, dear; I hope you are not quite worn out
after that dreadful journey."</p>

<p>"I am not the very least bit tired," returned
a fresh young voice, and Marjorie returned her
aunt's kiss so heartily that Mrs. Carleton was
rather startled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"We were twenty minutes late," Mr. Carleton
said, in answer to his wife's remark, but he
kissed her affectionately before putting the question
she was dreading.</p>

<p>"And where is Elsie?"</p>

<p>"She will be here in a few moments," Mrs.
Carleton explained hurriedly. "Now do come
in and have some tea, or is it too late for tea?
I am so glad to have you back, Henry dear; we
have missed you terribly. I am sure you must
be tired even if Marjorie isn't."</p>

<p>"Not so tired as hungry; we had a very poor
lunch on the train. It is rather late for tea,
though; we can have an early dinner instead.
Where is that little witch, Elsie? Isn't she coming
to see us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, dear; I told you she would be
here in a few moments. Now I will take Marjorie
to her room; she will be glad to wash off
some of those horrid cinders, I am sure." She
glanced as she spoke at Marjorie's linen shirt-waist,
and the straw hat, which certainly did not
look as if it had come from a New York milliner.</p>

<p>"Am I not to have the same room with Elsie,
Aunt Julia?" Marjorie inquired, in a tone of
some disappointment, as Mrs. Carleton led the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
way down a long, narrow entry, with doors on
both sides.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, dear; you are to have a nice little
room all to yourself. It was so fortunate that
we had this extra room in the apartment. We
intended using it for guests, but when your uncle
wrote that he was bringing you home with him,
we decided to give it to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope I am not going to be in the way,"
said Marjorie, blushing. "I had no idea I was
to have a room to myself, especially when Uncle
Henry told me you were living in a hotel. I
wouldn't in the least mind rooming with Elsie."</p>

<p>"But you are not at all in the way," said Mrs.
Carleton, kindly. "We seldom have guests
staying with us, and shall not need the extra
room. This is Elsie's room; yours is just opposite."</p>

<p>At that moment Elsie's door opened, and that
young lady emerged, followed by the French
maid, who was still fastening her dress. At
sight of her cousin Marjorie sprang forward, and
before Elsie at all realized what was happening
to her, two eager arms were round her neck, and
she was being hugged in a manner that fairly
took away her breath.</p>

<p>"Oh, Elsie, I am so glad!" cried Marjorie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
rapturously. "Isn't it too wonderful and beautiful
that we should really meet at last? Do let
me look at you; I want to see if you are like
what I pictured you." And Marjorie held her
astonished cousin off at arms' length, and surveyed
her critically.</p>

<p>"What did you expect me to be like?" Elsie
inquired, not without some curiosity, as she
gently extricated herself from Marjorie's embrace.
She had taken in every detail of her
cousin's appearance in one glance.</p>

<p>"I don't exactly know&mdash;at least it is rather
hard to describe," said Marjorie, with an embarrassed
laugh. Something in Elsie's expression
was making her vaguely uncomfortable.
"I didn't think you would be quite so grown up
as you are."</p>

<p>"I am nearly fifteen," said Elsie, as if that
fact alone were quite sufficient to account for her
"grown up" appearance. "Is Papa in the
drawing-room, Mamma?"</p>

<p>"Yes, darling; run and speak to him; he is expecting
you. This is your room, Marjorie; I
hope you will find it comfortable."</p>

<p>"It's a beautiful room," declared Marjorie,
heartily, "only&mdash;only, are you quite sure you
want me to have it, Aunt Julia?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quite sure," said Mrs. Carleton, smiling.
"I suppose your trunk will be here before long.
Hortense will unpack for you, and help you to
dress for dinner."</p>

<p>Marjorie's eyes opened wide in surprise, and
she glanced at the white-capped French maid,
who still lingered in the background.</p>

<p>"You are very kind, Aunt Julia," she said
politely, "but I don't need any help; I always do
everything for myself."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton looked a little embarrassed.</p>

<p>"You may go, Hortense," she said, turning to
the maid; "Miss Marjorie will ring if she wants
you. You mustn't let her think you don't need
her, dear," she added in a lower tone, as the
maid left the room. "She is rather inclined to
be lazy, and she will take advantage of you if
you are too easy with her."</p>

<p>Marjorie said nothing, but she was both puzzled
and uncomfortable. Mrs. Carleton, however,
did not appear to notice that anything was
wrong.</p>

<p>"I will leave you for a little while now," she
said. "You must make yourself at home; your
uncle and I want you to be very happy here."</p>

<p>The quick tears started to Marjorie's eyes, and
she impulsively held out her hand to her aunt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
But Mrs. Carleton did not notice the gesture, and
in another moment she had left the room, closing
the door after her. In the entry she encountered
Elsie returning from the interview with
her father. Elsie was not in the best of spirits.</p>

<p>"Papa has sent me to stay with Marjorie,"
she said in a discontented whisper. "He says
he is afraid she is homesick. Oh, Mamma, did
you ever see such clothes?"</p>

<p>"Never mind about the clothes, dear," said
her mother, with forced cheerfulness; "we shall
soon fit her out with new ones. I think she will
really be quite pretty when she is properly
dressed."</p>

<p>Elsie shrugged her shoulders, but made no
further remarks, and the next moment she was
tapping at her cousin's door.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad you've come!" was Marjorie's
joyful greeting. "Now we can have a
nice talk before my trunk comes. Sit down in
this comfortable chair and I'll take the little one.
Isn't this a lovely room, and wasn't it sweet of
your mother to say she hoped I should be happy
here? Oh, I wonder if you can possibly be one
half as glad to see me as I am to see you."</p>

<p>Elsie was puzzled, but she was a little flattered
as well. She was not a general favorite among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
her companions, and to find a cousin who had
evidently been longing to make her acquaintance
was rather an agreeable experience. So her face
brightened considerably, and her voice was quite
pleasant as she remarked, sinking into the comfortable
arm-chair Marjorie had indicated&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is very interesting to meet you. I have
often heard papa speak of you and your mother
and father."</p>

<p>"Why, of course you have," laughed Marjorie,
wondering in her simple way whether all
New York girls of fifteen were as "grown up"
as Elsie. "I don't believe though that you have
thought half as much about me as I have about
you. You see, it's different in Arizona. There
aren't very many people, and they all live a long
way from each other. Ever since I can remember
I have longed for a girl friend. But with
you it must be very different, going to school
and living in a big city. I suppose you have lots
of friends."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have a good many," said Elsie,
with her little society air. "I am not very fond
of them all, though; some girls are so stupid."</p>

<p>"I hope you will like me," said Marjorie, a
little wistfully. "We ought to be even more
than friends because we are cousins, and I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
always thought that a cousin must be the next
best thing to a sister. Don't you often long for
a sister?"</p>

<p>"Why no, I don't," Elsie admitted. "Indeed,
I am not sure that I should care for one at all.
I think being an only child is very pleasant,
though of course having an older brother would
have its advantages. He would introduce one to
his friends and bring them to the house. Are
you fond of boys?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I like them very well, but I have
never known many. In fact, I haven't known
many people of any kind except Indians and
Mexicans."</p>

<p>"Indians and Mexicans!" repeated Elsie in a
tone of dismay. "How perfectly awful! You
don't mean that you make friends of those dreadful
people we saw on the train coming home
from California, do you?"</p>

<p>"They are not all dreadful creatures," said
Marjorie, flushing. "They are not quite like
white people, of course, but some of them are
very good. I know a Mexican boy who is just
as bright and clever as he can be. His father is
going to send him to college next year. Then
there is Juanita; she has lived with us for years,
and we are all very fond of her."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't know you were talking about
servants," said Elsie. "I thought you meant
friends. Hadn't you any real friends?"</p>

<p>"Not the kind of friends you mean. I had
Father and Mother and Aunt Jessie, but until
last August when Undine came, I had never
spoken to a white girl of my own age."</p>

<p>"Undine, what a queer name. Is she a Mexican
or an Indian?"</p>

<p>"She isn't either," said Marjorie, laughing,
"and Undine isn't her real name. We only call
her that because we don't know what her name
is. It's a very interesting story, and I'll tell you
all about it, but here comes my trunk, and I suppose
I had better unpack and change my dress
before dinner."</p>

<p>In spite of Marjorie's reiterated assurances
that she didn't need any help, Hortense reappeared,
and insisted on making herself useful.
She was very polite and talked volubly in broken
English about Mademoiselle's being <i>fatiguer</i>
and how glad she, Hortense, would be to assist
her in every way, but Marjorie could not help
feeling uncomfortable, and wishing that the well-intentioned
maid would go away and leave her
to unpack by herself. But what made her still
more uncomfortable was the fact that Elsie also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
lingered, and regarded every article that came
out of that modest leather trunk, with a keen,
critical eye.</p>

<p>"What are you going to wear down to dinner?"
she inquired anxiously as the last things
were being stowed away in the bureau drawers.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Marjorie; "I hadn't
thought about it. I suppose my gray flannel
suit, or else a clean shirt-waist and duck skirt."</p>

<p>Elsie clasped her hands in horror.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't, you can't possibly!" she cried
in real dismay. "Those things will do very well
for breakfast and luncheon, but everybody
dresses here in the evening. Let me see what
you can wear. You haven't got much, but I
suppose that white muslin will do."</p>

<p>"But that is my very best dress," protested
Marjorie, her cheeks crimsoning from embarrassment
and distress. "I don't think Mother
would like to have me wear it the first evening.
I won't have anything left for really grand occasions
if I do."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you will," said Elsie, confidently.
"Mamma is going to buy you a lot of new
clothes; that was all arranged before you came.
It would never do to have you going about everywhere
in these things."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Marjorie glanced at her cousin's stylish, well
fitting blue chiffon and her heart was filled with
dismay. Was it possible that all her mother's
and aunt's <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'stiches'">stitches</ins> had been taken in vain? It
was very kind of Aunt Julia to wish to buy her
pretty clothes, but she did not like to have her
present wardrobe spoken of as "those things."
Before she had time to say any more on the subject,
however, Mrs. Carleton appeared, to tell
them to hurry, as her husband was impatient for
his dinner.</p>

<p>That first dinner in the big crowded hotel restaurant
was a wonderful revelation to Marjorie.
The bright lights, the gay music, the ladies in
their pretty evening dresses, it was all like a
vision of fairyland, and for the first few minutes
she could do nothing but gaze about her and
wonder if she were awake.</p>

<p>"And do you really know all these people?"
she whispered to Elsie, when they were seated at
one of the small tables, and a waiter had taken
their order.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, no," laughed Elsie, who was
beginning to find this unsophisticated Western
cousin decidedly amusing. "We don't know one
of them to speak to."</p>

<p>Marjorie's eyes opened wide in astonishment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"How very strange," she said. "I supposed
people who lived in the same house always knew
each other. We know everybody at home, even
if they live ten miles away."</p>

<p>"Well, this isn't Arizona, you know," said
Elsie, shrugging her shoulders, and Marjorie,
feeling as if she had somehow been snubbed, relapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>Just then a lady and a gentleman and a boy of
eighteen or nineteen came in, and took their seats
at an opposite table. Elsie, who had appeared
quite indifferent to all the other guests, instantly
began to show signs of interest.</p>

<p>"There they are," she said eagerly, addressing
her mother. "The gentleman is with them
again to-night, too. I forgot to tell you,
Mamma; I've found out their name, it's Randolph."</p>

<p>"How did you find out?" Mrs. Carleton
asked, beginning to look interested in her
turn.</p>

<p>"Lulu Bell told me to-day walking home from
school. That boy passed us on the Avenue, and
I asked her if she didn't think he was handsome.
She said she knew who he was, though she had
never met him. His uncle is a Dr. Randolph,
and a friend of her father's. This boy and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
mother are from Virginia, and are spending the
winter here. He is a freshman at Columbia, and
his mother doesn't want to be separated from
him, because she is a widow, and he is her only
child. Lulu says Dr. Randolph has asked her
mother to call on his sister-in-law. He said they
had taken an apartment at this hotel for the winter.
I made Lulu promise to introduce me if
she ever had the chance, but she may never even
meet him. She is such a queer girl; she doesn't
care the least bit about boys."</p>

<p>"A very sensible young person, I should say,"
remarked Mr. Carleton, dryly. "How old is
your friend Lulu?"</p>

<p>"Nearly fourteen; quite old enough to be interested
in something besides dolls, but she's
dreadfully young for her age."</p>

<p>"I wish some other little girls were young for
their age," said Mr. Carleton; "it doesn't appear
to be a common failing in these days."</p>

<p>Elsie flushed and looked annoyed.</p>

<p>"That boy really has a very nice face," put in
Mrs. Carleton, anxious to change the subject,
"and his devotion to his mother is charming. I
suppose her husband must have died recently;
she is in such deep mourning."</p>

<p>While the others were talking, Marjorie,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
whose eyes had been wandering rapidly
from one group to another, had finally fixed
themselves upon the party at the opposite table.
They certainly looked attractive; the gentleman
with the strong, clever face, and hair just turning
gray; the pretty, gentle little mother in her
black dress, and the handsome college boy, with
merry blue eyes. It was quite natural that Elsie
should want to know them, but why in the world
didn't she speak to them herself without waiting
to be introduced? It seemed so strange and inhospitable
to live in the same house with people
and not speak to them. So when her aunt had
finished her remarks about the Randolph family,
she turned to Elsie and inquired innocently:</p>

<p>"If you want to know that boy so much why
don't you tell him so?"</p>

<p>There was a moment of astonished silence;
then Elsie giggled.</p>

<p>"You are the funniest girl I ever met, Marjorie,"
she said. "Why don't you do it yourself?"</p>

<p>"Elsie," said her mother in a tone of shocked
reproof, and turning to Marjorie, she added
gravely:</p>

<p>"When you have been in New York a little
longer, my dear, you will learn that it is not the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
proper thing for young girls to speak to strangers
to whom they have not been introduced."</p>

<p>There was no doubt about the snub this time,
and poor Marjorie was horribly embarrassed.
She cast an appealing glance at her uncle, but he
appeared to be absorbed, and finding no help from
Elsie either, she relapsed into silence, and did not
speak again for at least five minutes.</p>

<p>After all, that first evening could scarcely be
called a success. Mr. and Mrs. Carleton were
very kind, and Elsie seemed disposed to be
friendly, but Marjorie was conscious of a sensation
of disappointment for which she could
scarcely account even to herself. She struggled
bravely against the homesickness which threatened
every moment to overwhelm her, and tried
to take an interest in all her new relatives' conversation,
but when dinner was over, and they
had gone upstairs again, she was not sorry to
avail herself of Aunt Julia's suggestion that she
must be "quite worn out," and slip quietly off
to bed. It was not easy to dispense with the
services of Hortense, who showed an alarming
tendency to linger and offer to assist, but even
she was finally disposed of, and with a sigh of intense
relief, Marjorie closed her door, switched
off the electric light, and crept into bed. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
followed a good hearty cry, which somehow made
her feel better, and then, being young and
very tired as well, she fell into a sound, healthy
sleep, from which she did not awaken until it was
broad daylight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>MARJORIE TAKES A MORNING WALK</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Marjorie opened her eyes the next
morning, she lay for some minutes thinking over
the events of the previous day, and listening to
the unusual noise in the street. There was so
much noise that she began to fear it must be very
late, and jumping out of bed, she went to look
at the clock. It was only just half-past six.
She had forgotten to ask at what hour the family
breakfasted, but seven o'clock was the usual
breakfast time at the ranch, so she decided that
it might be well to dress as speedily as possible.
She felt very wide awake indeed this morning,
and suddenly remembered that she had not had
a walk or ride since leaving home.</p>

<p>"I'll get Elsie to come with me for a good
long tramp after breakfast," she said to herself.
"If she can't go on account of school, I'll ask
Uncle Henry to let me walk with him to his office,
and I can come back by myself."</p>

<p>Greatly to Marjorie's relief, no Hortense appeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
with offers of assistance, and she performed
her morning toilet in peace. She put on
the gray flannel suit, which Elsie had pronounced
"good enough for breakfast and luncheon," and
then once more glancing at the clock, discovered
that it was still only five minutes past seven.</p>

<p>"If they breakfast at seven I shall be only
five minutes late," she said, with a feeling of satisfaction;
"I should have hated to be late the
first morning. Perhaps they won't have it till
half-past, and then I shall have time to write a
few lines to Mother first."</p>

<p>She opened her door, and crossed the hall to
the drawing-room, where her aunt had told her
the family usually breakfasted, in preference to
going downstairs to the restaurant, but somewhat
to her surprise, she found the room just as she
had left it on the previous evening, and the whole
apartment seemed very quiet. She went to one
of the windows and looked out.</p>

<p>"What a lot of people there are in the street,"
she remarked reflectively, "and they all seem in
such a hurry. I wonder where they are going.
How pretty the park is. Oh, how I should love
a gallop on Roland before breakfast."</p>

<p>The door behind her opened, and a woman
with a duster in her hand came in. She looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
very much surprised at finding the room occupied.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Marjorie, with her
friendly smile; "it's a lovely day, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's very pleasant," returned the chambermaid,
still looking surprised. "You are up
early, Miss," she added politely.</p>

<p>"Am I?" said Marjorie, surprised in her turn.
"I didn't know I was. At what time do my
aunt and uncle generally have breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Never before half-past eight, and sometimes
later. Mrs. Carleton generally has her breakfast
in bed, but Mr. Carleton and the young lady have
theirs in here."</p>

<p>"Half-past eight," repeated Marjorie in dismay,
"and it's only a little after seven now. I
should say I was early."</p>

<p>The maid smiled, and began dusting the ornaments
without making any further remarks.
She did not appear to be a very communicative
person, and Marjorie decided that she might as
well go back to her room, and write the letter to
her mother, which could now be a much longer
one than she had at first intended. But on the
way she suddenly changed her mind.</p>

<p>"I can write later just as well," she decided,
"and it really is much too beautiful to stay indoors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
I'll go and have a walk in that lovely
park. I shall feel much more like breakfast when
I've had some fresh air and exercise."</p>

<p>Marjorie had not the least idea that she was
doing anything unusual as she ran lightly down
the broad marble stairs five minutes later, and
stepped out through the open street door into the
fresh morning air. The Carleton's apartment
was on the fifth floor, but Marjorie scorned to
use the lift, which had struck her the evening
before, as a very wonderful but unnecessary invention.</p>

<p>Several people in the hall looked at her curiously,
and a man in brass buttons asked her if
he should call a cab.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, thank you," said Marjorie, pleasantly;
"I'm going for a walk," and she passed
out, without another backward glance.</p>

<p>It really was a glorious morning, and Marjorie
drew in long deep breaths of the keen autumn
air, as she crossed the broad avenue and
entered the park. She was not disappointed in
her first impression that the park was beautiful,
and the further she walked among the trees and
broad asphalt paths, the more attractive it became.
It was the last of October, but the autumn
had been a warm one, and the grass was almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
as green as in summer. To Marjorie, accustomed
all her life to the arid prairie, where
trees and flowers were practically unknown, it all
seemed very wonderful, and she enjoyed every
step. She walked rapidly on for some distance,
paying no particular attention to the direction
she was taking. The possibility of getting lost
never once entered her mind. She met very few
people, and they all seemed in a hurry, and
looked like men and women on their way to their
day's work. Once she passed a forlorn-looking
man asleep on a bench, and remembered what
Undine had once said about a tramp. This must
be a tramp, she felt sure, and she paused to regard
him with interest as a new specimen of humanity.</p>

<p>Suddenly she came to a standstill and looked
about here. She was in a quiet path, with rocks
on both sides, and there was not a soul in sight.</p>

<p>"I must turn back," she said, with an uncomfortable
recollection of the passing of time. "I
was enjoying my walk so much I never realized
how far I was going, but I'm afraid I shall have
to hurry now if I don't want to be late for breakfast."</p>

<p>Accordingly she turned her steps in the direction
from which she had come, and walked on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
rapidly for several minutes. But alas! she had
taken more than one turn since entering the park,
and going back was no such easy matter as she
had imagined. The more she tried to remember
the way she had come, the more bewildered she
became.</p>

<p>"I declare, I believe I am lost!" she said at
last, with a feeling of amused dismay. "I must
be more careful to notice where I am going next
time. Oh, there is one of those men in uniform,
that Uncle Henry said were policemen. He will
be able to tell me if I'm going right."</p>

<p>She quickened her steps, and approaching the
officer, inquired politely:</p>

<p>"Will you please tell me if this is the way to
the entrance?"</p>

<p>"Which entrance?" inquired the policeman,
regarding her curiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Marjorie; "the entrance
I came in&mdash;are there more than one?"</p>

<p>"A good many more; which avenue do you
want?"</p>

<p>Marjorie's heart was beginning to beat rather
fast. For the moment she could not remember;
even the name of the hotel&mdash;which she had
only heard once or twice&mdash;had escaped her
recollection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have forgotten the name of the street," she
said helplessly, "but it's the entrance opposite
the big hotel."</p>

<p>The policeman looked uncertain, but at that
moment a young man riding a bicycle appeared
upon the scene, at sight of whom Marjorie's face
brightened, and she uttered a little gasp of relief.</p>

<p>"That young gentleman knows," she exclaimed
joyfully, and, quite forgetful of her
aunt's snub of the evening before, she darted
forward, and hailed the youth on the bicycle
quite as if she had been an old friend.</p>

<p>"Oh, please excuse me for stopping you," she
cried, eagerly, "but you know where I want to
go, and I have forgotten the name of the hotel."</p>

<p>The young man brought his bicycle to a standstill;
sprang to the ground, and snatched off his
cap. He was evidently very much surprised, but
too polite to show it.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said in a very pleasant
voice; "can I be of any assistance to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Marjorie, frankly. "I saw you
in the hotel dining-room last night, and I heard
my cousin say you lived there. I came out for
a walk before breakfast, and&mdash;it's very stupid I
suppose&mdash;but I can't find my way back to the
entrance where I came in."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>A look of comprehension came into the
young man's pleasant face, and he regarded
Marjorie with interest not unmixed with
amusement.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said; "you are staying at
the 'Plaza,' and want to go back there."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the name," said Marjorie, looking
much relieved; "will you please show me the
way to the gate?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said her new acquaintance, smiling,
and he at once began to lead the way, pushing
his bicycle along beside him.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you want to get on your wheel
again?" Marjorie inquired anxiously. "I can
easily follow if you don't go too fast."</p>

<p>The young man protested that he had ridden
quite long enough, and would be glad of a little
walk.</p>

<p>"You are very kind," said Marjorie, heartily.
"It was very stupid of me to lose my way; I
never was lost before."</p>

<p>"And do you often walk here in the park?"
her new friend inquired, politely.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I was never here before. I only
came to New York yesterday; my home is in Arizona."</p>

<p>"You have come a long distance," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
"And how do you like New York&mdash;that is to
say as much as you have seen of it?"</p>

<p>"I think it is very noisy and rather smoky,
but the hotel is beautiful, and so is this park.
I haven't seen much of New York yet, but I am
going to spend the winter here."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you as to the noise and
smoke," said her companion, smiling, "but New
York is a pretty jolly place notwithstanding. It
isn't my home either; I am from Virginia."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you are," said Marjorie, innocently.
"You came here to go to college, and
your mother is with you. My cousin told us all
about it last evening at dinner."</p>

<p>The young man laughed outright. It was
such a merry laugh that Marjorie could not help
joining in it, and after that they were excellent
friends.</p>

<p>"Now I wonder if you would mind telling
me how your cousin obtained her information,"
Marjorie's new friend said when he had recovered
his gravity. "I haven't met her, have I?
What is her name?"</p>

<p>"Elsie Carleton. No, she hasn't met you yet,
but she wants to very much. A friend of hers
has promised to introduce you if she has a chance.
Your name is Randolph, isn't it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Beverly Randolph, at your service. I
shall be very glad to meet your cousin, I am sure.
Perhaps you will introduce us."</p>

<p>"Of course I will if you like. It seems very
queer not to know a person who lives in the same
house with one, but Elsie says they don't know
any of the people at the hotel. It was all so different
at home."</p>

<p>Then Beverly Randolph asked some questions
about Arizona, which set Marjorie off on a description
of the ranch, and her life there, which
lasted until they reached the Fifth Avenue entrance.</p>

<p>"That's the gate I came in," exclaimed Marjorie.
"I wasn't so far away, after all. Would
you mind telling me what time it is?"</p>

<p>Beverly Randolph took out his watch.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes past nine," he said, looking
somewhat dismayed in his turn; "I had no idea
it was so late. Luckily it is Saturday, so there
are no recitations to miss."</p>

<p>"O dear! I am afraid I am terribly late for
breakfast," said Marjorie, feeling very much
ashamed of herself. And without another word,
they hurried across the avenue, and entered the
hotel, where the very first person Marjorie saw in
the entrance hall was her uncle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Henry, I am so sorry to be late!"
she cried remorsefully, springing to Mr. Carleton's
side. "I hope you and Aunt Julia aren't
annoyed with me."</p>

<p>"Where in the world have you been, Marjorie?"
her uncle demanded, ignoring the latter
part of her remark. He was looking decidedly
annoyed as well as worried.</p>

<p>"Why, I got up early," Marjorie explained,
"and the girl who was dusting said you never
had breakfast before half-past eight, so I thought
I would go for a walk in the park. I got lost,
and couldn't remember the name of the hotel,
but fortunately, just as I was beginning to be a
little frightened, I met Mr. Beverly Randolph,
and he brought me home."</p>

<p>"And who is Beverly Randolph? I had no
idea you had friends in New York."</p>

<p>"Oh, he isn't exactly a friend&mdash;at least he
wasn't till this morning. You know who he is,
Uncle Henry; that nice-looking boy Elsie was
talking about at dinner last night. Wasn't it
fortunate I recognized him. He is just as nice
as he can be, and I'm going to introduce him to
Elsie."</p>

<p>"Come upstairs at once," said Mr. Carleton,
a trifle less sternly. "We have been very anxious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
about you; you must never do such a thing
again."</p>

<p>Marjorie was dumb with astonishment. Beyond
being late for breakfast she had no idea
that she had done anything wrong. She followed
her uncle in silence, and did not utter another
word until they had reached their own
apartment, where they found Mrs. Carleton in a
condition bordering on hysteria, and Elsie trying
to look solemn, but secretly rather enjoying the
situation. "I should really think, Marjorie, that
you might have known," said Mrs. Carleton in a
tone of deep reproach, when she had heard her
niece's explanation, "your own common sense
should have told you that to go wandering off
by yourself in a strange city at seven o'clock in
the morning, was a most extraordinary thing to
do. You must never again go out alone at any
hour. Elsie has never been out without a maid."</p>

<p>Marjorie's eyes opened wide in amazement.</p>

<p>"Not go out alone?" she repeated stupidly.
"Why I've always gone everywhere by myself
ever since I was a little girl."</p>

<p>"Well, you are not to do it here, whatever you
may have done in Arizona," said Mrs. Carleton,
crossly. "As for speaking to a strange young
man, and getting him to bring you home, I really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
never heard of anything so outrageous. We have
been frightened to death about you."</p>

<p>"There, there, Julia," put in Uncle Henry,
"don't you think you have said enough? I am
sure Marjorie will never do such a thing again;
she will soon be accustomed to New York ways.
Now suppose you let the child have some breakfast;
she looks about ready to drop."</p>

<p>But it was not want of food that had driven
the color from Marjorie's cheeks and the light
from her eyes. Indeed, she had but small appetite
for the tempting breakfast that was set before
her, and it was only by a mighty effort that
she was able to keep back the burst of homesick
tears which threatened every moment to overpower
her.</p>

<p>At the same moment that Mrs. Carleton was
administering her reproof to Marjorie, Beverly
Randolph was giving his mother an account of
the morning's adventure, as they sat together at
breakfast in their pleasant sitting-room on the
floor below.</p>

<p>"I know you would like the little girl,
Mother," he ended; "she is such a natural, jolly
sort, and there isn't one bit of nonsense about
her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph smiled as she poured her son's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
coffee, and regarded him with proud, loving
eyes.</p>

<p>"You never have admired the 'sort' with nonsense
about them, have you, dear?" she said
rather mischievously.</p>

<p>"I haven't any use for them," said Beverly
with decision. "I like girls well enough when
they behave decently, but the silly giggly ones
get on my nerves. This one&mdash;Marjorie Graham
she says her name is&mdash;is all right, though.
I think I know the cousin by sight, and I don't
feel so sure about her."</p>

<p>"You mustn't be too fastidious, Beverly," said
his mother, laughing. "I dare say they are both
nice little girls. By the way, I have received an
invitation from that charming Mrs. Bell, who
called the other day, asking us both to dine with
her next Tuesday. Her husband is an old friend
of Uncle George's, you know. Mrs. Bell told
me she had a daughter of thirteen or fourteen, so
that will be another acquaintance for you."</p>

<p>"Well, if she is like most of the New York
girls I've seen I sha'n't care much about her," declared
Beverly. "I prefer the ones that come
from Arizona. Honestly, Mother, I want you to
meet that little girl. I don't know what it was
about her, but she reminded me of Babs."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>A look of pain crossed Mrs. Randolph's sweet
face, but her voice was still quite cheerful as she
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very well, dear, be sure to introduce her to
me; I want to know all your friends."</p>

<p>As soon as she could escape from her relatives
after breakfast, Marjorie fled to her own
room, there to have her cry out, and pull herself
together, before starting on a shopping expedition
with her aunt. Elsie was going to lunch with a
schoolmate, but Aunt Julia had ordered the carriage
and told Marjorie that she intended devoting
the day to shopping.</p>

<p>"You are to begin school on Monday," she
explained, "and I must get you some decent
clothes as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Marjorie supposed she ought to be grateful,
but she could not help resisting the fact that her
aunt evidently did not consider her present wardrobe
"decent," and this, added to her other
troubles, resulted in a very unhappy half-hour.
But Marjorie was a plucky girl, and she had
plenty of common sense.</p>

<p>"I won't write a word about all this to Mother
or Aunt Jessie," she decided as she dried her
eyes. "It wouldn't do any good, and they would
be so sorry. I am sure Aunt Julia means to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
kind, and I suppose I did frighten them, but it
does seem so silly not to be allowed to go out for
a walk by one's self."</p>

<p>She had just bathed her red eyes, and was sitting
down to write the deferred letter to her
mother, when the door opened, and Elsie came
in.</p>

<p>"Mamma says you are to be ready to go out
with her in fifteen minutes," she began, then
paused, regarding her cousin curiously. "You
look as if you'd been crying," she said abruptly.
"Mamma did pitch into you pretty hard, but it
was an awfully queer thing to go out by yourself
at seven o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry I did what was wrong," said
Marjorie, "but I had no idea any one would object.
I often go for a gallop on my pony before
breakfast at home."</p>

<p>"Oh, I daresay you do, but that is very different.
I think it was too funny that you should
have met Beverly Randolph. Do tell me what he
is like."</p>

<p>"He is very nice indeed," said Marjorie,
frankly; "I liked him ever so much."</p>

<p>"You'll be sure to introduce us, won't you?
It will be such fun to tell Lulu Bell I've met him
first; not that she'll care much, she's such a baby.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Mamma thinks she may call on Mrs. Randolph
to thank her."</p>

<p>"What does she want to thank her for?" inquired
Marjorie, innocently.</p>

<p>"Why, for her son's bringing you home, and
being so kind to you. You might have been lost
for hours if he hadn't done it."</p>

<p>"But his mother had nothing to do with that,"
persisted Marjorie. "Besides, he was on his
way home, anyway. He was very nice, but I
don't see what there is to thank his mother for."</p>

<p>Elsie reddened, and looked a little annoyed.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it doesn't matter," she said carelessly.
"Mamma would like to call on Mrs.
Randolph, and this makes a good excuse, that's
all. She says the Randolphs of Virginia are a
very old family. Now hurry and get ready; the
carriage will be here in a few minutes."</p>

<p>Marjorie said no more on the subject, but she
was puzzled. It was only natural that Aunt
Julia should wish to make the acquaintance of a
lady who lived in the same house with her, but
why was it necessary to have an excuse for doing
so? She was beginning to think that there
were going to be a great many new things to learn
in New York.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>NEW FRIENDS AND NEW FASHIONS</h3>


<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'>

"November 6th.<br />
</div>

"<span class="smcap">Dearest Aunt Jessie</span>:

<p>"I am at home alone this evening; Uncle
Henry and Aunt Julia have gone out to dinner,
and Elsie is at a party. I am going to write you
a long, long letter, and try to tell you every single
thing that has happened.</p>

<p>"I have been here just a week, and I think I
am beginning to get more accustomed to things.
It is all very interesting, but some of it does seem
a little queer, and, oh, how I do wish I could have
a good talk with Mother or you, and ask you to
explain the things I don't understand. Aunt
Julia is very kind, but I could never talk to her
as I do to you and Mother. The things that
puzzle me most are what it is proper to do and
what isn't. For one thing, they say it isn't proper
to speak to people unless one has been introduced.
At home we always speak to every one whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
they are in the 'Social Register' or not. The
Social Register is a book, and Elsie says the
names of all the nice people are in it, and when
her mother wants to find out who people are, and
whether or not she wants to have Elsie know
them she just looks for their names in the Social
Register, and if she finds them there she knows
they are all right. Then it isn't considered
proper for girls to go out by themselves in New
York. I have seen some nice-looking girls alone
in the streets, but Elsie says they can't be the
kind one wants to know. Hortense, the French
maid, always goes out with Elsie and me, and
even carries our books to school for us. Hortense
is very nice, but it is rather a bother having
her always about, and she wants to do a great
many more things for me than I really need.
But the greatest difficulty of all is that Elsie isn't
fond of walking, and I do miss my tramps dreadfully.
We walk to school and back every day,
but it isn't far, and in the afternoon Elsie is always
having engagements. So I go driving with
Aunt Julia, and, oh, but it does seem slow! Aunt
Julia hates to drive fast, and I sometimes feel as
if I would give anything to jump out of the carriage
and have one good run. I know I could
easily keep up with those horses if it were only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
proper to run behind the carriage, but of course it
isn't.</p>

<p>"I ought not to object to going out with Aunt
Julia, for she has been very good to me. She is
having some perfectly lovely dresses made for
me, and has bought me two simply wonderful
hats. I am not sure whether Mother would quite
approve of all my new clothes. Some of them
do look very grown-up, but then the girls here
are all much more grown-up than I had any idea
they would be. Elsie puts up her hair, and
wanted me to put mine up, too, but I knew
Mother wouldn't like it, and Uncle Henry said I
was right.</p>

<p>"I have been at school every day since Monday,
and like it very much indeed. It is not a
large school, only a class of twelve girls. The
teacher's name is Miss Lothrop, and Elsie and
several of the other girls have been going to her
since they were quite little. Miss Lothrop is
lovely, and all the girls have been very kind and
polite to me. The two I like best are Lulu Bell
and Winifred Hamilton. Elsie says they are
both very young for their age, and I think perhaps
that is the reason I like them better than
some of the others. Winifred is only thirteen,
but she is just as sweet as she can be, and Lulu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
is awfully pretty, and a great favorite. Carol
Hastings is another girl in the class, and Elsie's
most intimate friend. She is only fourteen, but
seems much older. I wonder why New York
girls seem to care so much about boys. I like
a nice boy ever so much myself, but I can't see
the use of giggling and looking silly every time
his name is mentioned. Carol Hastings came
here to dinner last night, and when Beverly Randolph
came over to our table to speak to us, she
was so silly I was really ashamed of her. I
spoke to Elsie about it afterwards, and she said
Carol was a goose, but I think she is a little bit
silly herself sometimes. I wrote Mother all
about Beverly Randolph, and how much I liked
him. I would give anything to have a brother
just like him. He adores his mother, and I don't
wonder, for she is lovely. He says she is so
jolly, and is always interested in everything he is
interested in; even the college games. His father
died when he was little, and I suppose this is one
reason why he and his mother are so much to
each other. There is an uncle, who is a doctor,
but he only comes to dine with them sometimes,
and lives somewhere else. Mrs. Randolph has
one of the sweetest faces I have ever seen&mdash;yours
and Mothers excepted&mdash;and she looks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
very young to be the mother of a big boy of
eighteen. She dresses in black, and looks rather
sad sometimes, but I suppose that is when she is
thinking of her husband.</p>

<p>"Elsie is very clever, and Aunt Julia admires
her tremendously. She says Elsie has always
been the brightest girl in her classes and that she
recites Shakespeare quite wonderfully. I haven't
heard her recite yet, but she plays the piano very
well, and takes music lessons twice a week. She
speaks French, too, and is beginning to study German.
Of course I am not nearly as far advanced
as she is, but Miss Lothrop says I am not backward
for my age, and that makes me very happy.
I was so proud when she asked me if I had a
governess at home, and I told her Father and
Mother had taught me everything I knew. I
don't think Elsie liked my saying that; she says
I mustn't talk about our being poor, but I am sure
I can't see why she should object. However, I
have promised to try not to say anything she
doesn't like; they have all been so good to me
that I do want to please them if I can.</p>

<p>"Last Tuesday was Aunt Julia's birthday, and
she gave a family dinner party. She has a good
many relatives, and they all came. I should think
Elsie would love having so many cousins, but she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
says she doesn't care very much about many of
them. Aunt Julia's two sisters were here, and I
thought the oldest one&mdash;Mrs. Lamont&mdash;was
lovely. Her daughter, Miss Annie, came with
her, and she was awfully nice and jolly. She is
quite old&mdash;about twenty-five I think&mdash;and she
works downtown in a settlement. I didn't know
what a settlement was, but Elsie explained that
it is a place where ladies go to live among very
poor ignorant people, and try to help them. She
and her mother send some of their old clothes
to Miss Lamont, and she gives them to the poor
women at the settlement. Aunt Julia's other
sister is Mrs. Ward. She is quite stout, and
talks a great deal about what is good for her to
eat and what isn't. She was nice, but I didn't
like her as much as the Lamonts. Her husband
is fat, too, and is always saying funny things that
make people laugh. They have two little girls,
but they were not allowed to come because Tuesday
was a school night, and they are never allowed
to go out anywhere except on Fridays and
Saturdays. Elsie can go out any night she likes,
because she is so clever that Aunt Julia says it
doesn't matter whether she misses her lessons one
day or not. There is a Ward boy, too, but he is
at Yale. Elsie likes him best of all her cousins,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and she says he is very fond of her, too. Aunt
Julia says all the boys admire Elsie very much,
but I think she is mistaken about Beverly Randolph.
He has such an honest face that he can't
hide his feelings, and when Elsie and Carol giggled
so much that night, and talked so very
grown-up, I am sure he was trying not to laugh.</p>

<p>"You can't begin to imagine how glad I was
to get your and Mother's precious letters. I read
them over and over until I almost knew them by
heart, and slept with Mother's first one under my
pillow all night. Father's letter was splendid
too, and I was so interested to hear all about the
new colts. I am so glad Undine is proving such
a comfort. I knew you couldn't help loving her,
she is such a dear, and she promised to try to
take my place. I told the girls at school about
her, and they thought it the most interesting thing
they had ever heard. Lulu Bell says she is going
to tell her aunt, who is an authoress, about it,
and ask her to put Undine in a book. Won't it
be too interesting if she really does?</p>

<p>"O dear! there is the clock striking ten, and
I have been writing ever since half-past eight.
I must stop now, and go to bed, or I shall be
sleepy to-morrow morning. Ten o'clock at night
used to seem very late indeed at home, but it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
seems quite early here. Elsie doesn't expect to
get home from her party before half past eleven.
Uncle Henry doesn't approve of late hours for
school-girls, but Aunt Julia says everybody in
New York keeps them, so it can't be helped. I
forgot to say the party is at Bessie Winston's.
She is one of the girls at Miss Lothrop's, and one
of Elsie's intimate friends. I was invited, too,
but Aunt Julia wouldn't let me accept, because
my new dresses haven't come home yet. Elsie
says I wouldn't have enjoyed it, anyway, because
I can't dance. She goes to a dancing class every
Saturday morning, and Aunt Julia says she may
have me go too after Christmas. I think I
should like dancing, for the sake of the exercise
if nothing else. Oh, how I do long for exercise!
Elsie rides in summer, but her pony is at
their country place on Long Island, and they
don't think it worth while to bring it in to New
York. Aunt Julia says Elsie has so many other
things to do in winter she has no time for riding.
What wouldn't I give for one good canter on
Roland! I can't help envying the girls I see riding
in the park, though none of them look as if
they were enjoying it as much as I should. They
all ride side-saddle, and I don't believe it can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
nearly as pleasant as riding astride, but Aunt
Julia told me not to say so, because it isn't considered
the thing to ride astride here. I saw
Beverly Randolph riding in the park this afternoon,
and he really did look as if he enjoyed it.
His home is in Virginia, and he says the people
there are very fond of horses. Lulu says Mrs.
Randolph owns a large plantation, and I suppose
a plantation is something like a ranch.</p>

<p>"Now I really must stop writing, for my hand
is getting tired, and I have made two big blots
on this page. So good night, Auntie darling.
If I could send all the love that is in my heart,
I am afraid no postman would be able to carry
the letter, it would be so heavy. So you must
just imagine it is there. I am really very happy,
though I can't help feeling homesick sometimes,
especially at night. I am going to work hard,
and try to learn so much this winter that you will
all be proud of me when I come home. I have
already begun counting the weeks; there are
just twenty-eight and a half till the first of June.
A winter does seem a very long time, but this
week has gone by faster than I expected. I will
write to Mother on Sunday, and your next letters
ought to be here by Monday. Letters are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the best thing in the world when one is so far
away from home, so please all write just as often
as you can to</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>MARJORIE ENGAGES IN BATTLE</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> most glorious thing is going to happen,
Marjorie," announced Elsie, as her cousin came
into the drawing-room to breakfast one November
morning, about two weeks after the writing
of that long letter to Aunt Jessie.</p>

<p>"What is it?" inquired Marjorie, regarding
Elsie's radiant face and sparkling eyes, with interest.
Elsie was not, as a rule, a very enthusiastic
young person.</p>

<p>"The most delightful invitation you ever heard
of," Elsie explained with a glance at the letter
her mother was reading. "It's from my cousin
Percy Ward. You know he's a sophomore at
Yale, and he wants Mamma and me to come to
New Haven for the football game next Saturday.
It's the big Yale-Harvard game, you know, and
I've been simply crazy to go, but it's almost impossible
to get tickets. It really was angelic of
Percy to get two for us, and he wants us to come
up on Friday afternoon so we can go to the dance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
that evening. He has engaged a room for us at
the hotel."</p>

<p>"It must be wonderful to see a great match
like that," declared Marjorie, with hearty appreciation
of her cousin's good fortune. "I
have seen pictures of the college games, and
Father always reads the football news in the
papers. He is a Harvard man himself, you
know, and used to be on the team."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you can't go with us," said Elsie,
regretfully, "but of course Percy couldn't get
more than two tickets. Perhaps you wouldn't
enjoy it much, though. It can't be much fun
unless you know a lot of the boys. Percy is such
a dear; he is sure to introduce me to all his
friends."</p>

<p>"I wish your father had not gone to Washington
on that tiresome business just now," remarked
Mrs. Carleton, laying down her nephew's
letter, and looking a little worried. "I should
have liked to consult him before answering
Percy."</p>

<p>"Why, Mamma, you surely don't think he
would object!" cried Elsie in dismay. "What
possible reason could he have for not wanting us
to go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no reason whatever, of course, dear. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
was only thinking of Marjorie. I am not sure
that he would like the idea of her being left here
alone while we are away."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother! Marjorie won't mind&mdash;will
you, Marjorie? Besides, she needn't be alone;
Hortense can sleep in my room, and it's only for
one night."</p>

<p>"Please don't worry about me, Aunt Julia,"
said Marjorie, blushing. "I shall get on all
right, I am sure, and it would be terrible to have
you and Elsie miss the game on my account. I
can have my meals up here while you are away,
and go out with Hortense."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Carleton did not look quite satisfied.</p>

<p>"You are very sweet and unselfish, dear," she
said, "but I wish Percy had bought another
ticket; then we could have taken you with us. I
cannot bear to disappoint Elsie, so I suppose I
shall have to accept the invitation, though I dislike
the idea of leaving you behind, especially at
a time when your uncle is away, too."</p>

<p>So the matter was settled, and as soon as breakfast
was over Mrs. Carleton sat down to write
her note of acceptance, while the two girls
started for school, accompanied as usual by Hortense.
Elsie was in high spirits, and entertained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
her cousin with a vivid description of the delight
and excitement of a college football match.</p>

<p>"Not that I have ever seen one myself," she
explained. "Papa hates crowds, and has always
said it was too difficult to get tickets, and
last year Percy couldn't get any either, being only
a freshman. Carol Hastings has been, though,
and she told me she was never so excited in her
life. The Bells are going this year, and have invited
Winifred Hamilton and Gertie Rossiter to
go with them. I can't see why they want to take
Winifred; she is such a baby, and I don't believe
a boy will notice her; but she and Lulu are such
chums, one never seems able to go anywhere
without the other."</p>

<p>"Beverly Randolph and his mother are going,
too," said Marjorie, who was making a great effort
to keep down the feeling of envious longing,
and to show a real interest and sympathy in
her cousin's anticipations. "He told me so yesterday.
His uncle, Dr. Randolph, is going to
take them in his automobile."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; I heard him talking about it.
I must be sure to tell him Mamma and I are going,
so he will look us up. Oh, here come Bessie
and Carol; I must tell them the good news."</p>

<p>Percy Ward's letter arrived on Wednesday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
morning, and on Friday afternoon soon after
luncheon, Mrs. Carleton and Elsie departed for
New Haven. Mr. Carleton had been called to
Washington on business, and was not expected
home before Saturday night. Aunt Julia was
very kind, and kissed Marjorie with more affection
than usual.</p>

<p>"I really hate to leave you," she said regretfully.
"If it were not for the disappointment it
would have been to Elsie, I would never have accepted.
I hope you will not be very lonely."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I won't," promised Marjorie cheerfully.
She was really touched by her aunt's
solicitude, and had almost, if not quite, succeeded
in banishing the feelings of envy and disappointment.
"I've got some hard lessons for Monday,
and I want to have them all perfect, so I can
write Mother that I haven't missed in any of my
classes for a week. Then Hortense says she likes
walking, so we can have some fine long tramps.
To-morrow night will be here before I've begun
to realize that you are away."</p>

<p>But despite her cheerful assurances, Marjorie's
heart was not very light when she accompanied
her aunt and cousin to the lift, and saw them
start, Elsie's face wreathed in smiles, and even
Aunt Julia looking as if she had not altogether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
outgrown her interest in a football game. She
went slowly back to her own room, and taking up
her Greek history, determined to forget present
disappointment, and spend the next hour with the
Greek heroes. But to make up one's mind to do
a thing, and to carry out one's good intentions
are two very different matters. Marjorie conscientiously
tried to fix her thoughts on "The
Siege of Troy," but the recollection of Elsie's
radiant face kept obtruding itself between her
eyes and the printed page, and at the end of half
an hour she threw down her book in despair.</p>

<p>"There isn't any use," she said to herself, with
a sigh; "I can't remember a single date. I'll
ring for Hortense, and ask her to take me for a
walk. Perhaps by the time we come back my
wits will have left off wool-gathering, and I shall
have a good long evening for studying and writing
letters."</p>

<p>Hortense was quite ready for a walk, and
really the afternoon was much less forlorn than
Marjorie had anticipated. The French maid had
taken a fancy to the little Western girl, who was
always kind and friendly in her manner, and did
not&mdash;as she told a friend&mdash;treat her as if she
were "<i>seulement une machine</i>." Elsie never
talked to Hortense during their walks, but this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
afternoon Marjorie was longing for companionship,
and she and the maid chatted together like
old friends. They were both young and far
away from home, and perhaps that fact had a
good deal to do towards drawing them together.
Marjorie was always glad to talk of her life on
the ranch, and Hortense told in her turn of the
little French village, where she had spent her
childhood, and of the widowed mother and little
brothers and sisters, to whom she sent more than
half of her earnings. She spoke in broken English,
with here and there a French expression
thrown in, but Marjorie had no difficulty in understanding,
and her interest and sympathy for
the plucky little French girl, who had left home
and friends to earn her own living, grew rapidly.</p>

<p>They took a long walk, for Hortense was almost
as fond of tramping as Marjorie herself,
and it was almost dusk when they at last came in
sight of the big hotel. Then Hortense suddenly
remembered an errand she had to do for Mrs.
Carleton, and Marjorie&mdash;who was not in the
least tired&mdash;declared her intention of accompanying
her.</p>

<p>"It is not far," the maid explained; "only to
Sixth Avenue. We shall not be more than a
quarter of an hour."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The errand accomplished they turned their
steps in a homeward direction, and were about
half way up Fifty-seventh Street, on their way to
the Plaza, when Marjorie's attention was attracted
by a horse and cart, which had come to a
standstill only a few feet in front of them. The
cart was loaded with boxes and packages, and the
horse, which was a mere skeleton, and looked as
if his working days had long been over, had evidently
completely given out. The driver, a boy
of sixteen or seventeen, had sprung down from
his seat, and was endeavoring to discover the
cause of the trouble.</p>

<p>"Oh, look, Hortense," cried Marjorie, her
quick sympathies instantly aroused, "look at that
poor horse. He isn't strong enough to drag that
heavy wagon, with all those boxes in it. Oh,
what a shame! That boy mustn't beat him so&mdash;he
mustn't!" And before the horrified maid
could interpose, impulsive Marjorie had sprung
forward to remonstrate.</p>

<p>"Stop beating that horse," she commanded,
with flashing eyes; "can't you see he isn't able
to go any farther with that load? You ought to
be ashamed to load a poor creature like that in
such a way!"</p>

<p>The boy stared at her for a moment in stupid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
amazement; then an ugly look came into his face.
He gave one quick glance up and down the street,
to make sure there was no policeman in sight;
and turned on Marjorie with rough fury.</p>

<p>"You leave me alone, will you? It ain't none
of your biz what I do with this here horse."
And before the indignant Marjorie could protest
he had again laid the whip lash, sharply across the
poor animal's back.</p>

<p>Then for one moment Marjorie forgot everything&mdash;forgot
that she was in the streets of a
big city&mdash;forgot all Aunt Julia's lectures and
Elsie's warnings&mdash;and with one quick movement
she seized the whip handle, trying with all her
strength to drag it away from the boy. She was
strong, but her antagonist was stronger, and the
end of that momentary struggle was a sharp cry
of pain from Marjorie, a muttered imprecation
from the driver, and in another second he had
sprung into his seat, and horse and wagon were
clattering away down the street.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mademoiselle, Mademoiselle," gasped
Hortense, seizing Marjorie's arm, and fairly
trembling with fright and horror; "how could
you do such a terrible thing? A young lady to
fight with a <i>canaille!</i> Oh, what will Madame
say when she hears?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'>With One Quick Movement She Seized the Whip Handle</span>.&mdash;Page 145.</span>
</div>

<p>"He is a wicked, cruel boy," panted Marjorie;
"he ought to be arrested. He is killing
that poor old horse."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, he is cruel, a beast, but young
ladies must not interfere with such things. You
might have been hurt. Let us go home quickly;
I am near to faint. Thank Heaven no one saw.
Madame would never forgive such a disgrace."</p>

<p>"But some one ought to interfere," protested
Marjorie, her wrath beginning to cool, "and
there wasn't anybody else to do it. I would
have taken that whip away from him if I could,
but he was so strong, and he has hurt my wrist."</p>

<p>"Hurt your wrist! Let me see. Ah, but it is
red. How could you have held on so tight?
Come home quickly, and we will bathe it with
arnica. How fortunate that Madame and
Mademoiselle Elsie are away! Ah, here comes
the young gentleman, Mademoiselle Elsie's friend
from the hotel; he must not know that anything
is wrong."</p>

<p>But Marjorie had no intention of keeping her
indignation to herself, and she turned to greet
Beverly Randolph with eyes that flashed and
cheeks that tingled.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Randolph," she exclaimed, as the
young man smilingly took off his hat, and paused<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
beside her, "the most dreadful thing has happened.
A cruel, wicked boy has been ill-treating
a poor old horse. The poor creature had a
terribly heavy load, and when he refused to go
any further, the boy beat him, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where is he?" inquired Beverly, his own
eyes beginning to flash. "I'll report the case to
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals."</p>

<p>"He has gone," said Marjorie, regretfully.
"He gave the horse a dreadful cut with the whip,
and it was so frightened it started, and then he
jumped into the wagon and went off. I tried to
get the whip away from him, but he was terribly
strong, and he hurt my wrist so much I had to
let go."</p>

<p>Beverly Randolph's face was a mixture of astonishment,
amusement and horror.</p>

<p>"You don't mean that you tackled the fellow
yourself?" he demanded incredulously.</p>

<p>Marjorie nodded. Now that the excitement
was over she was beginning to feel a little startled
at what she had done.</p>

<p>"I had to," she said humbly; "there wasn't
any one else to do it. Hortense thinks it was
very unladylike, but I don't see what else I could
have done. I couldn't just stand by and do nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
while that poor horse was being ill-treated."</p>

<p>"No, I don't suppose you could," said Beverly,
smiling. "I don't think I would do it
again, though; you might get hurt. Hello!
what's the matter?&mdash;don't you feel well?"</p>

<p>For Marjorie had suddenly grown very pale,
and leaned against the lamp-post.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's my wrist," she faltered; "it hurts
dreadfully, and&mdash;and I think I feel a little
faint."</p>

<p>Without a moment's hesitation Beverly drew
the girl's arm through his.</p>

<p>"Come along," he said, peremptorily, and
without another word he conducted the wounded
soldier back to the hotel. Marjorie, too, was silent;
the pain in her wrist was very bad, and she
had to bite her lips hard to keep back the rising
tears. Hortense, still covered with shame and
confusion, followed close behind. At the door
of the lift Beverly paused.</p>

<p>"Is your aunt at home?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"No," said Marjorie, unsteadily; "she and
Elsie have gone to New Haven for the football
game."</p>

<p>"To be sure they have; I had forgotten.
Your cousin told me they were going this afternoon.
Well, I think I will take you to our apartment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
My mother is used to sprains and bruises,
and will know what to do for your wrist."</p>

<p>Marjorie protested that she could not think of
disturbing Mrs. Randolph, but Beverly, who appeared
to be accustomed to having his own way,
remained firm, and in the end his companion was
forced to yield, much to the distress and horror
of Hortense, who considered that the story was
already known to more persons than Mrs. Carleton
would approve.</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph and her brother-in-law were
having tea in the former's pretty sitting-room,
when the door was unceremoniously flung open,
and Beverly appeared on the threshold, leading in
a trembling, white-faced girl, who immediately
collapsed into the nearest chair, and looked as
if she were about to faint.</p>

<p>"It's Miss Marjorie Graham, Mother," Beverly
explained, "and she has hurt her wrist.
Her aunt is away, so I brought her in here. Oh,
here's Uncle George; what luck! This is my
uncle Dr. Randolph, Miss Marjorie; he is a surgeon,
you know, and he'll fix you up in no
time."</p>

<p>"To be sure I will if I can," said a pleasant
voice, not unlike Beverly's. "Let me see what
the trouble is. Ah, this is the hand, isn't it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
And Marjorie felt her wrist taken in firm, kind
fingers. She winced at the touch, but the doctor's
next words were reassuring.</p>

<p>"I see; only a slight sprain, nothing serious.
Have you some arnica, Barbara, and some linen
that I can use for a bandage?"</p>

<p>"How did it happen, dear?" Mrs. Randolph
inquired sympathetically, as Marjorie leaned back
in her chair, with a sigh of intense relief, and
the doctor applied a cooling lotion to her aching
wrist.</p>

<p>Marjorie's cheeks were crimson again, but not
for a moment did she hesitate about telling the
truth. Beverly had gone off to his own room,
having left his charge in safe hands.</p>

<p>"I am afraid it was my own fault," she said,
honestly. "I saw a boy ill-treating a poor old
horse, and tried to stop him by getting the whip
away from him, but he was much stronger than
I, and in the struggle I suppose he must have
twisted my wrist. I am afraid your son and my
aunt's maid both think I was very unladylike."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph and the doctor exchanged
amused glances, and the latter said kindly:</p>

<p>"I wish more people were moved by the same
spirit, though I don't know that I should advise
young girls to attack rough drivers. I imagine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
you have not been very long in New York or you
would be accustomed to such sights."</p>

<p>"No," said Marjorie, much relieved. "I
have only been in New York three weeks. My
home is on a ranch in Arizona, but I have been
accustomed to horses all my life. I think my
father would almost kill any boy who dared to
treat one of ours like that."</p>

<p>"I daresay he would. Your father raises
horses, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and cattle, too. I have lived on the
ranch ever since I was two years old, and New
York seems very strange in some ways."</p>

<p>"It must," said Dr. Randolph gravely, but his
eyes twinkled, and Marjorie felt sure he was trying
not to laugh. "There, I think the wrist will
do nicely now. You can wet this bandage again
in an hour, and if I am not mistaken the pain will
be gone by that time. I must be going now, Barbara;
I have two patients to see before dinner.
I'll call for you and Beverly in the car at nine to-morrow
morning; that will give us plenty of time
to make New Haven before lunch." And with a
hurried leave-taking the doctor departed, leaving
Mrs. Randolph and Marjorie alone together.</p>

<p>The next half-hour was a very pleasant one.
Mrs. Randolph would not allow the girl to go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
back to her own apartment until the pain in her
wrist had subsided, and she made her lie on the
sofa, and petted her in a way that recalled Mother
and Aunt Jessie so strongly that Marjorie had
some difficulty in keeping back the homesick tears.
Almost before she knew it, she was chatting away
to this new acquaintance as if they had been old
friends.</p>

<p>"I hope I shall get accustomed to New York
ways soon," she said humbly. "I am afraid I
make a great many mistakes, and they distress
my aunt and cousin very much. You see, it is all
so different on the ranch. I suppose your son
told you how I spoke to him that morning in the
park, and asked him to take me home. It seemed
quite a natural thing to do, because I knew he
lived in this hotel, but Aunt Julia was dreadfully
shocked."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph laughed.</p>

<p>"Beverly was not at all shocked," she said.
"He and I have rather old-fashioned ideas about
some things; we like little girls to be natural."</p>

<p>"I am so glad you think me a little girl still,"
said Marjorie in a sudden burst of confidence.
"All the girls here seem so grown-up, and I
don't want to grow up just yet; I am only fourteen."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"My little girl would have been just about
your age if she had lived," said Mrs. Randolph,
with a rather sad smile. "I am sure I should
not have begun to think of her as grown-up
yet."</p>

<p>Marjorie was interested. She would have
liked to ask Mrs. Randolph about her little girl,
but feared the subject might be a painful one,
and just that moment Beverly came back, and
the conversation turned on other matters. In a
little while Marjorie rose to go.</p>

<p>"You have been very kind to me," she said to
Mrs. Randolph. "My wrist feels ever so much
better already. I do hope I haven't been a
bother."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," Mrs. Randolph declared,
laughing. "On the contrary, I have enjoyed
your call very much, and I hope you will
come often, for I am very fond of little girls.
By the way, what are you going to do to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Marjorie; "walk
and read and study, I suppose. Aunt Julia said
I might drive in the afternoon, but the horses
go so slowly I always feel as though I should
like to get out of the carriage and run. Galloping
over the prairie is much more fun."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph and her son both laughed, and
Beverly remarked rather indignantly:</p>

<p>"It's a shame you couldn't have gone to the
game with the others."</p>

<p>"Oh, that wasn't Aunt Julia's fault," said
Marjorie, loyally. "Her nephew only sent two
tickets, and Elsie says it's almost impossible to
get extra ones. They were very kind about it,
and Aunt Julia hated to leave me behind."</p>

<p>Beverly and his mother exchanged a significant
glance, and then Beverly offered to accompany
the visitor as far as her own apartment for the
purpose of carrying the arnica bottle, which Mrs.
Randolph insisted she should keep in case of
necessity. Marjorie protested, but Beverly was
firm, and the two young people left the room together,
after Mrs. Randolph had kissed the girl,
and told her she must come again very soon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>A MOTOR RIDE AND A FOOTBALL GAME</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I think</span> your mother is perfectly lovely,"
declared Marjorie, the moment the door of the
Randolph's apartment had closed behind them.
"Is she always so kind to strangers?"</p>

<p>"Mother's a brick," said Beverly, heartily.
"She's kind to everybody, and always doing
things for people. She's a good sport, too. I
really believe, she is looking forward to the game
to-morrow almost as much as I am. It's because
she's so unselfish; she never stops to think of
herself so long as other people are having a good
time."</p>

<p>"My aunt is like that," said Marjorie, with
shining eyes. "She is a great invalid, and suffers
very much most of the time, but she never
complains, and is always interested in everything
we do. Is your uncle a surgeon?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Beverly, rather surprised by the
abruptness of the question; "he is a very fine
surgeon, I believe. Why do you want to know?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Aren't you satisfied with the way your wrist is
bandaged?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't that," said Marjorie, blushing;
"it was only something I was thinking of that
made me ask the question. This is our apartment;
now I can take the bottle, and not bother
you any more. Oh, there's a letter in the box;
perhaps it's for me!" And forgetting everything
else in her eagerness for home news, Marjorie
sprang forward to possess herself of the
contents of the letter-box.</p>

<p>"It is for me!" she cried joyfully, glancing
at the postmark. "It's from Undine; the first
one I've had from her."</p>

<p>"Undine," repeated Beverly, his eyes beginning
to twinkle; "I had no idea you counted
water sprites among your acquaintances."</p>

<p>"She isn't a water sprite," laughed Marjorie.
"She's just a girl like anybody else. We call her
Undine because nobody knows what her real
name is. It's a very strange story indeed. She
was found under some ruins in the streets of San
Francisco right after the earthquake, and we
think a stone or something must have fallen on
her head, for she was unconscious for a long
time, and now she can't remember anything that
happened before the earthquake, not even her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
own name. She isn't crazy, or anything like
that, but she has simply forgotten everything.
Did you ever hear of a case like that before?"</p>

<p>"I think I have read of such cases, but I imagine
they are rather rare. It is very interesting,
but if you don't mind, Miss Marjorie, please
don't mention it to my mother. Any mention of
the San Francisco earthquake is very painful to
her. My little sister was killed there."</p>

<p>"No, indeed I won't," promised Marjorie,
"but how very sad about your sister. Would
you mind telling me how it happened? Don't
talk about it, though, if you would rather not."</p>

<p>"I don't mind in the least," said Beverly,
"but it was such a frightful shock to my mother
that we don't like to have her dwell on it any
any more than can be helped. My sister Barbara
was in San Francisco with my aunt at the
time of the earthquake. She had been very ill
with scarlet fever in the winter, and the doctor
had ordered a change for her. My aunt was going
to California for a few weeks, and offered to
take Barbara with her. Mother couldn't leave
home, for she was taking care of my grandmother,
who was ill at the time, and I was away
at school. So it ended in my aunt and Barbara
going by themselves. My aunt intended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
taking a maid, but the one she had engaged disappointed
her at the last moment, and as all the
railroad accommodations had been secured, she
decided to start, and trust to finding a suitable
maid in San Francisco, which was to be their first
stopping place. They reached San Francisco,
and my aunt wrote my mother that she had engaged
a very satisfactory girl, and two days later
came the earthquake."</p>

<p>Beverly paused abruptly, and Marjorie, her
face full of sympathy, laid a kind little hand on
his arm.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me any more," she said, gently;
"it must have been very terrible."</p>

<p>"It was," said Beverly, sadly. "Part of the
wall of the hotel where they were staying fell in,
and they were both instantly killed. We feared
for a time that my mother would never recover
from the shock."</p>

<p>"And was the maid killed, too?" Marjorie
asked. She was longing to hear more, but did
not like to ask too many questions.</p>

<p>"We never knew; you see, she was a stranger
to us. My uncle advertised in all the California
papers, in the hope of finding her, and perhaps
learn more particulars, but no answer ever came.
She was probably killed, poor thing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your mother spoke of her little girl this
afternoon," said Marjorie; "she said she would
have been just about my age."</p>

<p>"Yes, she would have been fifteen this January.
It is rather odd, but when I saw you that
first morning in the park you somehow reminded
me of Babs. She was such a jolly little girl.
She was four years younger than I, but there
were only we two, and we were always chums."</p>

<p>There was a look of such genuine sorrow on
the boy's face that impulsive Marjorie held out
her hand.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," she said and that was all, but
Beverly understood, and he went back to his
mother's apartment with a very kindly feeling
for the little girl from Arizona.</p>

<p>Once in her own room Marjorie speedily forgot
the Randolphs and their troubles in the delight
of a letter from home. Undine's handwriting
was rather immature for a girl of her
age, but the letter itself was most interesting and
satisfactory.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'>
"November Fifteenth.<br />
</div>

"<span class="smcap">Dear Marjorie</span>:

<p>"Your aunt thinks you would like to have a
letter from me, and although I can't see how you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
can possibly care about hearing from such a
stupid person, I am very glad to write.</p>

<p>"You have no idea how much I have missed
you. If your mother and aunt had not been so
very kind I don't think I could have borne it, but,
oh, Marjorie dear they are so good; I do hope I
can deserve just a little of all they are doing for
me. Your mother is making me a new dress&mdash;isn't
it sweet of her? She sent to Albuquerque
for the material; it is dark blue serge with a little
stripe in it, and just as pretty as it can be. I
take a sewing lesson every day from Miss Jessie,
but I know as well as can be that I shall never
learn to make things as you do.</p>

<p>"Another thing that makes me very happy is
that your mother is giving me lessons, and letting
me recite to her every evening. Even if I
am stupid and can't remember my own name, I
don't want to grow up ignorant. We are reading
English history together, and it is very
strange, but I almost always know what is coming
next. Mrs. Graham says she feels sure I
must have learned the same things before.</p>

<p>"A very strange thing happened to me one
day last week; I think I almost remembered. It
was the day your long letter to Miss Jessie came,
and she was reading it aloud to us when it happened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
It was just like the day I heard Jim singing
'Mandalay' for the first time. It seemed to
me just for one minute that I was going to remember
everything, and I was so excited I
screamed, and frightened Mrs. Graham and Miss
Jessie. Then in a flash it was all gone again,
and I was so unhappy I couldn't help crying. I
am afraid I gave them a good deal of trouble,
but they were so kind! Afterward Miss Jessie
talked to me for a long time, and made me
promise to try not to worry any more about not
remembering. She said some lovely comforting
things about my being helpful and trying to take
your place, and they made me very happy, although
I am afraid I didn't really deserve them.</p>

<p>"I ride almost every afternoon, and I think
Roland is beginning to like me. I never forget
his sugar, and I am teaching him to put his nose
in my pocket for it. I think I must have taught
another horse that some time, it seemed so natural,
but I am not sure. I have promised your
aunt not to talk about the things I think I used
to do.</p>

<p>"I had such a beautiful dream last night. I
thought some one came and told me I was very
rich, and I was so happy, because I would have
the money to pay a surgeon to come and see Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Jessie. I was just planning out how I was to
do it when I woke up. I have thought a great
deal about what you told me that last evening,
but of course I have never mentioned it to any
one. I don't suppose you have had time to meet
a surgeon yet.</p>

<p>"I must stop writing now, and study my history.
Everybody is well, and they all send heaps
of love and kisses. Your mother says 'don't
let Marjorie know how much we miss her,' but
I am sure you know that without any telling. I
don't want to be selfish, but I should just love a
letter all to myself some time. New York must
be a very interesting place, and your letters telling
about it all are wonderful.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"With a heart full of love, I am</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"Your true but nameless friend,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Undine.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>Marjorie spent a busy evening over her lessons,
and went to bed at nine o'clock instead of
writing the home letters she had intended.</p>

<p>"They would be so sorry to know I was here
all by myself while the others were off having a
good time," she thought, resolutely crushing down
that troublesome little feeling of envy. "If I
wrote to-night I should have to mention it, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
if I wait till Sunday when Aunt Julia and Elsie
are back again, I won't have to say anything
about their having been away. I promised
Mother to let her know about all the things, but
some of them will keep till I get home and can
tell her myself."</p>

<p>But in spite of the throbbing pain in her wrist,
and the disappointment in her heart, Marjorie
soon feel asleep, and did not wake until it was
broad daylight, and Hortense, with a note in her
hand, was standing by her bedside.</p>

<p>"It is only seven," the maid said apologetically,
as Marjorie sat up in bed, and rubbed her
eyes. "I would not have called you so early, but
the hall boy has brought this note, and waits for
an answer."</p>

<p>"What in the world can it be?" exclaimed
Marjorie in astonishment, as she tore open the
envelope, but at the first glance at the contents
her face brightened, and she uttered a joyful little
cry. This is what she read.</p>

<div class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">My Dear Marjorie</span>:

<p>"I know you won't object to my calling you
Marjorie, because you say you like being a little
girl. I am writing to ask if you will go with us
to New Haven to-day. We are going in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
brother-in-law's car, and are to be ready to start
at nine o'clock. The friend we expected would
go with us has been prevented at the last moment,
which gives us an extra seat in the car
as well as a ticket for the game, and we
should be delighted to have you with us. I am
sure your aunt would not object, and I will explain
everything to her myself. I would have
written you last evening, but it was after ten
when we learned that the friend we had expected
would be unable to go. We have ordered breakfast
for eight o'clock, and would be glad to have
you take it with us. Be sure to wrap up well,
for it may be a cold ride, and we shall not get
back till late.</p>

<p>"Hoping that you will be able to join us, I remain</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 2.5em;">"Sincerely your friend,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Barbara Randolph.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>Marjorie was out of bed almost before she had
finished the last line. Her eyes were dancing,
and her heart pounding with excitement.</p>

<p>"Tell the boy to say I shall be delighted to
go," she cried. "There isn't time to write a
note; I shall have to hurry. Oh, Hortense, did
you ever hear of anything quite so splendid?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a very radiant Marjorie who presented
herself at the Randolphs' apartment an hour
later, and Beverly and his mother felt fully repaid
for the kindly impulse which had prompted
the invitation. The breakfast that followed was
a very pleasant one, and Marjorie chatted away
to her new friends as if she had known them all
her life, and enjoyed herself more than she had
done at any time since coming to New York.</p>

<p>"I really didn't know how disappointed I was
about not going till your mother's note came,"
she said to Beverly, when breakfast was over,
and Mrs. Randolph had gone to put on her hat.
"I have always longed to see a football game.
My father was on the team at Harvard."</p>

<p>"You seemed to take your disappointment
rather cheerfully," said Beverly with characteristic
bluntness.</p>

<p>Marjorie blushed.</p>

<p>"It was just one of the things that couldn't be
helped," she said simply. "My aunt says there
are some things every one has to make the best
of."</p>

<p>"Your aunt must be a sensible woman," remarked
Mrs. Randolph, who had returned just in
time to hear Marjorie's last sentence. Thereupon
Marjorie launched forth into an account of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Aunt Jessie's bravery and cheerfulness, in which
both her companions seemed interested.</p>

<p>Marjorie was sure she would never forget the
delight of that motor ride to New Haven. It
was her first ride in an open touring car, and the
bright sunshine, the keen frosty air, and the swift
motion, all combined to render the trip a truly
enjoyable one. She sat in the tonneau, between
Mrs. Randolph and the doctor, and Beverly occupied
the front seat with the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"It's the most heavenly motion I ever imagined,"
murmured Marjorie, as they bowled
swiftly out of the park and along the grand boulevard.
"I always thought riding was the most
delightful thing in the world, but I believe motoring
is even better."</p>

<p>The doctor laughed.</p>

<p>"You must be an accomplished horsewoman,"
he said. "Beverly tells me you have spent a
good part of your life on a ranch."</p>

<p>"I rode my first pony before I was five, and
helped Father train a colt when I was nine," said
Marjorie. "I suppose that is one reason why
I love horses so much, and can't bear to see one
ill-treated."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it, but if I were you I
think I would leave the punishment of cruel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
drivers in future to the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals. By the way, how is
the wrist this morning?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's ever so much better," said Marjorie,
blushing at the memory of her escapade. "I
don't believe I have thought of it once since Mrs.
Randolph's note came. I have been so anxious
to see a real college football match. My father
was on the team at Harvard."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the doctor, looking interested.
"I am a Harvard man myself, and there was a
Graham on the team in my time; a splendid chap&mdash;what
is your father's name?"</p>

<p>"Donald, and he was in the class of 1890,"
said Marjorie, eagerly. "Oh, I wonder if you
can really have known Father."</p>

<p>"I certainly did. Ninety was my class, too,
and I remember Donald Graham very well,
though we have never met since the old college
days."</p>

<p>"How perfectly delightful!" cried Marjorie,
with sparkling eyes. "Father will be so interested
when I write him about it."</p>

<p>Dr. Randolph was really pleased to hear of his
old classmate, forgotten for nearly twenty years,
and he and Marjorie were soon in the midst of
an animated conversation; she telling of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
father's busy life on the Arizona cattle ranch,
and he relating college stories, and growing young
again himself in recalling those old merry
days.</p>

<p>That was a wonderful ride, and Marjorie enjoyed
every moment. Dr. Randolph told her
the names of all the towns they passed through,
and Beverly and his mother were so kind and so
merry. It was noon when they reached New
Haven, where they found the streets crowded
with people and automobiles, and many of the
buildings decorated with flags and Yale colors.</p>

<p>"Have all these people come to see the game?"
Marjorie asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Yes, and a good many more as well," Dr.
Randolph told her. "There is always a big
crowd for these games; the railroads run special
trains on purpose. We are going to have lunch
now, and then go out to Yale Field."</p>

<p>"I wonder if we shall meet Aunt Julia and
Elsie," said Marjorie. "How surprised they
will be to see me if we do. Aunt Julia will be
pleased, I know, for she hated to leave me at
home."</p>

<p>"We shall meet the Bells and their party at
any rate," said Beverly. "They came yesterday
by train, and are saving a table for us at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
restaurant. You know Lulu Bell, don't you,
Marjorie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is in my class, and I like her ever so
much. I like Winifred Hamilton, too, and she
is to be with the Bells, I believe."</p>

<p>At that moment they drew up before the hotel
where they were to lunch, and Mrs. Randolph
and Marjorie hurried away to the dressing-room
to remove wraps and motor veils, while the doctor
and his nephew went to order luncheon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>MARJORIE SURPRISES HER RELATIVES</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I really</span> don't know when I've been so
pleased about anything!" exclaimed Lulu Bell, a
pretty, bright-faced girl of fourteen, as she and
her friends greeted Marjorie in the restaurant.
"We were all so glad when Beverly Randolph
told us you were here. Won't Elsie be surprised?
She hadn't the least idea you were coming.
Come here and sit between Winifred and me."</p>

<p>"I don't believe any one can be much more
surprised than I am myself," said Marjorie,
laughing, as she took the proffered seat, and received
the kindly greeting of her other schoolmates.
"Wasn't it just heavenly of the Randolphs
to bring me with them?"</p>

<p>"It was nice," Winifred Hamilton agreed
heartily. "This is my first football game, too,
and I'm almost too excited to eat. Did you ever
see such a crowd in your life?"</p>

<p>"No, never," said Marjorie, with a glance
round the packed restaurant. "I wonder if they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
will really have lunch enough for all these people.
Do you suppose Aunt Julia and Elsie are here?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so," said Winifred. "We
saw Elsie at the dance last night, and she said
they were going to lunch with some friends of
her cousin's. She will be at the game, of course,
and perhaps you may see her there."</p>

<p>"I think it was real mean of Elsie to come
without you," chimed in Gertie Rossiter, who
was not noted for tact. "I should have hated to
go off for a good time and leave my cousin at
home alone."</p>

<p>"Oh, Elsie couldn't help it," protested Marjorie;
"her cousin could only get two tickets."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" retorted Gertie indignantly.
"He could have gotten an extra one as well as
not if he had known in time; he told me so last
night. I know Percy Ward very well, and he's
an awfully nice boy. He felt dreadfully sorry
when he heard about your being left behind. He
said it was just like Elsie."</p>

<p>"Isn't Mrs. Randolph pretty?" broke in Winifred,
anxious to change the subject before Gertie
made any more uncomfortable revelations.
"She looks awfully young to be that big boy's
mother."</p>

<p>"She is perfectly lovely," declared Marjorie,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and Lulu added, by way of keeping the conversation
in safe channels:</p>

<p>"Papa knows her brother-in-law, Dr. Randolph,
very well, and he says she is the bravest
woman he has ever met. You've heard about
her little girl, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Marjorie, "it was very sad; I
don't see how poor Mrs. Randolph ever got over
it."</p>

<p>"She didn't," said Lulu. "Dr. Randolph says
it nearly killed her, and even now she can't bear
to speak of it, but she doesn't think it right to
sadden her son's life, and so she is always bright
and cheerful. If I ever write a book I shall
make my heroine just that sort of person."</p>

<p>At this moment Beverly, who had gone to
speak to some friends at another table, joined the
party, and the subject of his family was dropped.
The luncheon was a very merry one. They were
a large party, for besides Lulu's father and
mother and the three girls, there were a couple of
Yale students, friends of the Bells, and everybody
seemed in excellent spirits. Marjorie felt
a little shy at first, but soon thawed under the
genial atmosphere, and before the meal was over
she was chatting and laughing as merrily as any
of the others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't Marjorie a nice girl?" whispered Winifred
to Lulu, as they were leaving the restaurant.
"I'm so glad she got the chance to come, but I
do wonder what Elsie will say."</p>

<p>It seemed to Marjorie that the next three hours
must be the most exciting period of her life. To
most girls a college football game is looked upon
as a rather important event, but to Marjorie,
fresh from her Arizona home, it was an experience
never to be forgotten. It was on the whole
a peaceful game, and there were no serious accidents
to mar the general enjoyment and as the
sun continued to shine, and the day was comfortably
warm, there were not even the usual discomforts
of weather to be endured. Marjorie
and her friends were about equally divided in their
championship; Lulu, Winifred and Gertie being
for Yale, while Beverly and Marjorie herself
favored Harvard, and joined in the cheers and
rejoicing when the "Crimson" at last carried off
the honors of the day, although Yale ran so close
behind that at one time fears had been entertained
that the game would be a tie.</p>

<p>"Are you tired, Marjorie?" Beverly asked, as
they were making their way through the dense
throng to the waiting motor-car.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I am or not," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Marjorie, laughing. "It has all been so wonderful,
and I don't feel as if I could quite realize
it yet. Oh, there they are!"</p>

<p>"Who?" demanded Beverly, looking round
in surprise. "Oh, I see, your aunt and cousin&mdash;do
you want to speak to them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I do; they'll be so surprised.
Why, Elsie is staring at me as if she didn't know
me."</p>

<p>To say that Mrs. Carleton and her daughter
were surprised would be but a mild way of expressing
their feelings. They were for the moment
literally speechless with astonishment.
Elsie was the first to recover her power of articulation.</p>

<p>"Is it really and truly you, Marjorie?" she
demanded, regarding her smiling cousin with
round-eyed amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes, it really and truly is," laughed Marjorie.
"I've been trying to find you all the afternoon,
but there was such a crowd. I knew you'd be
surprised."</p>

<p>"Surprised!" echoed Elsie, looking from
Marjorie to her tall companion, "I was never
so surprised in my life. But how did it happen&mdash;who
brought you?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Randolph and his mother," said Marjorie,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
"wasn't it perfectly lovely of them?"
And she proceeded to give her aunt and cousin
an account of recent events.</p>

<p>"I am sure it was extremely kind of Mrs.
Randolph," Mrs. Carleton said, when Marjorie
had finished her story. "I only hope this little
girl hasn't been a trouble to your mother, Mr.
Randolph."</p>

<p>"Indeed she hasn't," declared Beverly, not
without some indignation in his tone. "We've
had a splendid time, haven't we, Marjorie?"
To which Marjorie, who felt suddenly as if a
pail of ice water had been dashed over her,
answered rather meekly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was beautiful. I never had such a good
time in my life."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that we must hurry along, Mrs.
Carleton," said Beverly. "My mother and uncle
have gone ahead, and will be waiting for us at
the entrance. Don't worry about Marjorie; we'll
take good care of her, and bring her home safely.
We may be a little late, as my uncle doesn't like
to run his car fast after dark."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall not worry," said Mrs. Carleton,
with her sweetest smile. "I know Marjorie is
in excellent hands, and between ourselves, I
think she is a very fortunate little girl."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Marjorie was rather silent during the long
ride back to New York that evening. Mrs. Randolph
and the doctor thought she was tired after
all the excitement of the day, and kindly left
her alone, but Beverly was of a different opinion,
and his feelings towards Marjorie's aunt and
cousin were not of the kindest.</p>

<p>"I suppose your aunt was very much surprised
to see you," Mrs. Randolph said kindly,
merely for the sake of conversation.</p>

<p>"Very much indeed," said Marjorie, in a tone
that was not altogether steady. "Oh, Mrs. Randolph,
I do hope I haven't been a trouble to you."</p>

<p>"A trouble! My dear child, what nonsense.
It has been perfectly delightful to have you with
us, and you have added greatly to our pleasure.
I hope we may have many more little trips together
before the winter is over. You know I
am very fond of little girls."</p>

<p>Marjorie was much relieved, but her heart was
not as light as it had been all day.</p>

<p>"Be sure to remember me to your father
when you write," were Dr. Randolph's parting
words to Marjorie, as they drew up before the
big hotel at ten o'clock that night. "Tell him
he mustn't forget to look me up when he comes
to New York."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed I will," promised Marjorie; "he will
be so interested. I don't suppose&mdash;" with sudden
eagerness&mdash;"that you ever go to Arizona?"</p>

<p>"I have never been there as yet, but nobody
knows what may happen. If I ever go to Arizona,
though, I shall certainly call on my old
college friend, Donald Graham."</p>

<p>"Isn't your uncle a dear?" remarked Marjorie
to Beverly, as her friend was taking her
upstairs to the Carletons' apartment.</p>

<p>"He's a brick," was the young man's hearty
rejoinder. "I'm glad you like him, for I know
he likes you. He doesn't take to everybody, but
he's been awfully good to Mother and me, and
he was very fond of my little sister. Here's
your door, so I'll say good-night. Hasn't it
been a jolly day?"</p>

<p>"It has been one of the loveliest days I've ever
had," said Marjorie earnestly. "I'm sorry Aunt
Julia thought I might have been troublesome, but
your mother said I wasn't."</p>

<p>"Troublesome! I should say not. Don't
bother about what your aunt says; she doesn't
know anything about it, and it's all nonsense, you
know."</p>

<p>Elsie had already gone to bed, and Mr. Carleton
had telegraphed that he was taking the midnight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
train from Washington, and would not
reach home till the following morning. But
Aunt Julia was still up and dressed, and awaiting
her niece's return.</p>

<p>"My dear child, how late you are," was the
rather reproachful greeting. "Do you know it
is nearly half-past ten? Elsie went to bed more
than an hour ago; she was quite worn out, poor
child, as indeed I am myself, but I couldn't make
up my mind to undress until I knew you were
safely at home. I am horribly afraid of those
automobiles."</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry you worried about me, Aunt
Julia," said Marjorie, regretfully. "I think we
were quite safe, though; Dr. Randolph's chauffeur
seems very careful, and they don't like going
fast. I wasn't a bit frightened."</p>

<p>"No, I don't suppose you were; children seldom
realize danger. Sit down, Marjorie; I want
to have a little talk with you before you go to
your room."</p>

<p>Marjorie complied, drawing a chair close to
the fire, and stretching her cold hands out to the
welcome blaze. She was longing to tell all about
the day's pleasures, and was glad of the prospect
of a little chat with Aunt Julia before going to
bed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now my dear," began Mrs. Carleton, speaking
fast and rather nervously, "I don't want you
to let what I am going to say make you unhappy.
I am not in the least displeased with you, because
I am sure you had no intention of doing anything
wrong; I have told Elsie so. But, Marjorie
dear, it is not quite the proper thing for a
girl of your age to accept invitations from
strangers without first consulting the people under
whose care she has been placed."</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Julia," cried Marjorie, clasping
her hands in dismay, while all the brightness died
suddenly out of her face, "I am so sorry! I
had no idea you would object to my going with
the Randolphs; I thought you would be pleased
because you were so sorry about leaving me at
home. Mrs. Randolph said she was sure you
wouldn't mind."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton moved uneasily in her chair, and
her eyes did not meet Marjorie's honest, astonished
gaze.</p>

<p>"I am sure it was very kind of Mrs. Randolph
to think of giving you so much pleasure," she
said. "I am not displeased with you either,
Marjorie; I am only warning you not to make
such a mistake another time. The Randolphs
are merely slight acquaintances of ours, and one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
doesn't like being under obligations to strangers,
you know. Elsie feels this quite as strongly as
I do."</p>

<p>"Elsie," repeated Marjorie, with a start, "why
does she care? Didn't she want me to go to the
game?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, dear; of course Elsie wanted you
to go. She would have been delighted if only
the circumstances had been a little different.
Don't look so distressed, Marjorie; there is really
nothing tragic in the situation. You have done
nothing wrong, and I am glad you have had such
a pleasant day, but don't accept another invitation
without consulting either your uncle or me.
Now kiss me good-night; I am tired to death and
simply cannot sit up another minute."</p>

<p>Marjorie cried herself to sleep that night for
the first time in weeks. In spite of the memories
of her happy day, she was more homesick than
she had been at any time since coming to New
York. She was so anxious to do right; to please
her uncle and aunt in every way, and show them
how grateful she was for all they were doing
for her. And now, without having the slightest
idea of having done anything wrong, she had
annoyed Aunt Julia. She was thankful Hortense
had not mentioned the episode of the cruel driver,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and that her wrist no longer required a bandage.
What would her aunt say if she knew of this
delinquency as well as the other? But Marjorie
was a very honest, truthful girl, and she decided
to make a clean breast of everything to Uncle
Henry when he came home. There was only one
thing she could not understand, and that was why
Elsie should have objected to her going to New
Haven with the Randolphs.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>THE POETRY CLUB</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a marked coolness in Elsie's manner
to her cousin the next morning, which Marjorie
found decidedly uncomfortable as well as
perplexing, but even Elsie was not proof against
the weakness of curiosity, and after a few veiled
hints, which Marjorie quite failed to understand,
she finally softened, and demanded a full account
of yesterday's doings, which her cousin was only
too glad to give.</p>

<p>"Tell me about Lulu Bell," said Elsie, when
Marjorie had reached the part of her story where
they had arrived at New Haven, and gone to
lunch at the hotel restaurant. "Did Beverly
Randolph pay her a lot of attention?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, I don't think so," said Marjorie,
innocently, "at least not any more than he paid
to any of us. He was very polite to everybody,
and I think he's the nicest boy I've ever met."</p>

<p>"Probably that is because you have never met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
many people except Mexicans and Indians," remarked
Elsie sarcastically.</p>

<p>Marjorie, who had a quick temper of her own,
flushed angrily, and was just going to say something
sharp when Mrs. Carleton called them to
get ready for church. Sunday was always a
homesick day with Marjorie; there was not so
much to do as on week-days, and she generally
wrote a long home letter in the afternoon. Mr.
Carleton had returned in time for breakfast, but
it was not until after luncheon that Marjorie
succeeded in getting him to herself. Then he
proposed taking a walk, and asked the girls to
accompany him. Elsie protested that she was too
tired after the exertions of yesterday, but Marjorie
gladly accepted her uncle's invitation, and
it was during that walk that she told her little
story, concealing nothing not even the battle
royal with the brutal driver. Mr. Carleton could
not help smiling over his niece's account of that
affair, although he grew grave again in a moment,
and told Marjorie she must never interfere
in such a case. But he saw nothing wrong in
her having accepted Mrs. Randolph's invitation.</p>

<p>"I daresay your aunt is right in wishing you
to consult her before accepting invitations as a
rule," he said, "but in this case I really don't see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
how you could have acted differently. The Randolphs
are charming people, and it was very kind
of them to offer to take you with them. It
would have been scarcely courteous to refuse."</p>

<p>Marjorie returned from her walk with a much
lighter heart, and in writing a long and detailed
account of the game to her father, she quite
forgot to worry over Elsie's sulks, or Aunt Julia's
warnings.</p>

<p>When the two girls arrived the next morning
at the building where Miss Lothrop held her
daily classes, they found several of their classmates
gathered in an eager group, all talking
fast and earnestly.</p>

<p>"The most interesting thing is going to happen,"
announced Gertie Rossiter, pouncing upon
the two new arrivals. "Lulu is getting up a
club, and she wants us all to join."</p>

<p>"What sort of a club?" inquired Elsie, doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, an awfully nice one. It's to meet at our
different houses on Friday evenings, and we are
to sew for the poor for the first hour, and dance
and play games the rest of the evening."</p>

<p>"I don't believe I should care to join," said
Elsie, indifferently, as she took off her hat, and
smoothed out her crimps; "I hate sewing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"So do I, but the sewing is only for the first
hour, and the rest will be such fun. The boys
will be invited to come at nine and stay till half-past
ten."</p>

<p>"Boys!" repeated Elsie her face brightening;
"are there to be boys in the club, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but of course they can't sew, so Lulu
is going to put them on the amusement committee.
My brother Rob is going to be asked, and
Bessie's two cousins, and any others we can think
of. You'll be sorry if you don't join, Elsie; it's
going to be splendid."</p>

<p>"I never said I wasn't going to join," said
Elsie loftily, and sauntering over to the window
where Lulu Bell and several other girls were still
in earnest conversation, she inquired with an air
of would-be indifference:</p>

<p>"What's all this about a club somebody is
getting up?"</p>

<p>"It's Lulu," said Winifred Hamilton, proudly;
"she thought of it yesterday and we all think
it's such a good idea."</p>

<p>"The first meeting is to be held at my house
next Friday evening," Lulu explained, "and
every member has got to read an original
poem."</p>

<p>"What for?" demanded Elsie, beginning to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
look rather blank. "I don't see what poems
have to do with a sewing club."</p>

<p>"Oh, we all have to be initiated," said Lulu,
"the way college boys are, you know, and the
way we are going to initiate is to make everybody
write a poem. It needn't be more than
eight lines, and it doesn't matter what it's about,
so long as it's poetry. It will be such fun reading
the poems and deciding which is the best.
The one who writes the best poem is to be president
of the club. It will be decided by vote."</p>

<p>"I think the club sounds very interesting," said
Elsie, with a little air of condescension, "but if
I were you I would give up the initiation; it's so
silly."</p>

<p>"Oh, the initiation is half the fun!" cried
Lulu and Bessie both together, and Lulu, who
was not very fond of Elsie, added with decision:</p>

<p>"Any one who isn't willing to take the trouble
to write a poem can't join the club."</p>

<p>"I am sure I have no objection to writing
a poem," said Elsie, shrugging her shoulders.
"It's perfectly simple; I could write one every
week if I chose, but it's so foolish."</p>

<p>Bessie and Gertie looked at each other, and
Gertie formed the word "brag" with her lips,
but did not say it aloud. Marjorie saw the look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
that passed between the two girls, and her cheeks
grew suddenly hot.</p>

<p>Elsie was certainly very clever, but she could
not help feeling that it would be better taste on
her cousin's part not to talk about it.</p>

<p>"I wish I found it easy to write a poem," said
Winifred, mournfully. "I never made a rhyme
in my life, but Lulu says I've got to try. She
made me write a story once when we were little
girls, and it was the most awful nonsense you
ever heard. Have you ever written a poem, Marjorie?"</p>

<p>"Only a few silly doggerels. One of my
aunt's favorite games is capping verses, and we
used sometimes to play it on winter evenings."</p>

<p>Just then more girls arrived, and in a few
moments Miss Lothrop rang her bell, and school
began.</p>

<p>"Well, Marjorie, what do you think of the
idea of the club?" Elsie inquired of her cousin,
as the two were walking home from school together
that day.</p>

<p>"I think it will be splendid," declared Marjorie,
heartily. "Lulu must be a clever girl to
have thought of such a plan, especially of the
initiation. I am sure the poems will be great
fun."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"They won't amount to anything," said Elsie,
with her superior smile. "Nobody will write a
decent poem, and I do hate poetry that isn't
really good. Papa would never allow me to
learn anything but the classics."</p>

<p>"Lulu says we mustn't read our poems to any
one until the night of the initiation," said Marjorie.
"I know yours will be splendid, Elsie;
you are so clever."</p>

<p>Elsie smiled, well pleased by the compliment,
and added rather irrelevantly:</p>

<p>"I asked Lulu why she didn't invite Beverly
Randolph to join the club. He hasn't many
friends in New York and might enjoy it. She
says he is older than any of the other boys, but
she would be glad to have him if he cares to join,
so I am to ask him and let her know to-morrow.
The boys are not to be initiated, because they are
only the amusement committee, but they are all
to come to the first meeting, and vote on the
poems."</p>

<p>Nothing more was said on the subject just
then, but Elsie was careful to deliver the message
to Beverly that evening, and the invitation was
readily accepted.</p>

<p>"The girl who writes the best poem is to be
president, you know," Elsie explained, with her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
sweetest smile. "You must be sure to come to
the first meeting and vote for the one you like
best."</p>

<p>"I am afraid I'm not very well up on poetry,"
said Beverly, laughing. "It's a lucky thing the
boys aren't expected to write poems as well as
the girls; I am sure I should disgrace myself
hopelessly if I were to attempt anything original."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you wouldn't," Elsie protested.
"You have no idea how easy it really is. Of
course some of the poems will be dreadfully
silly, but you don't have to vote for them."</p>

<p>It was Thanksgiving week, so school closed
on Wednesday, not to open again till the following
Monday. Elsie had several invitations for
the holidays, but Marjorie, whose New York
acquaintances were still limited to the girls at
Miss Lothrop's, had only the first meeting of
the Club on Friday evening to which to look forward.
She wrote her poem on Wednesday evening,
while Elsie was at a theater party, and although
far from satisfied with it, decided that
it would have to do, as she had several hard lessons
to prepare for Monday, and there was no
more time for writing poetry.</p>

<p>"Of course it won't be nearly as good as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Elsie's," she told herself cheerfully. "She is
sure to be voted president."</p>

<p>She had asked her cousin that evening if she
had written her poem, and Elsie had replied carelessly
that there was plenty of time, and she
would probably do it to-morrow.</p>

<p>"It really isn't worth bothering about," she
had added, with some scorn; "it won't take me
half an hour."</p>

<p>The next day was Thanksgiving, and the
Carletons and their niece were invited to a family
dinner at Mrs. Lamont's. Elsie spent a long
time in her room that afternoon, and came out
looking rather cross. Marjorie, going into her
cousin's room for something later in the day,
noticed that the waste-paper basket was full of
torn papers.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she can be having trouble with
her poem," Marjorie thought innocently, but when
she questioned Elsie on the subject, that young
lady colored angrily, and replied that of course
she wasn't, and she did wish people would stop
talking about that silly Club; she was sick of the
subject and had a great mind not to join at all.</p>

<p>The dinner at the Lamonts was very pleasant,
and Marjorie could not help being conscious of
the fact that she looked unusually well in her new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
dress. Every one was kind to the little Western
girl, and she liked Mrs. Lamont and her daughter
better than ever. The Ward family were also
of the party, and Marjorie was introduced to
the Yale boy, Percy, whom she found most
agreeable, though not, as she wrote her mother
afterward, quite so nice as Beverly Randolph.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me what a jolly girl
Marjorie Graham was?" Percy demanded of
Elsie, when the cousins were alone together for
a moment after dinner.</p>

<p>Elsie flushed.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you'd like her," she said,
evasively. "She's dreadfully young for her age,
and not a bit like the New York girls."</p>

<p>"Well, she's all right anyway," maintained
Percy. "I only wish I'd known about her in
time to get another ticket for the game last Saturday.
But she went with some other friends,
didn't she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she went," said Elsie, with a rather
sarcastic smile. "She got some people at the
hotel to take her in their car. You needn't
worry about Marjorie; she knows how to take
care of herself."</p>

<p>Elsie spent another hour in her room on Friday
morning, and was so cross and disagreeable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
at luncheon, that Marjorie wondered more and
more what the matter could possibly be. But in
the afternoon Elsie cheered up, and her cousin
came to the conclusion that whatever the trouble
had been, it was evidently over.</p>

<p>The meeting was to begin at eight o'clock, so
immediately after an early dinner, the two girls,
accompanied as usual by Hortense, started in the
carriage for Lulu's home, which was on Madison
Avenue, only a few blocks away.</p>

<p>Lulu was a charming little hostess, and gave
her friends a cordial greeting, explaining that her
mother and aunt would come down later, but it
had been a stipulation with some of the Club
members that nobody grown up was to hear the
poems or take part in the initiation. Several of
Miss Lothrop's girls had already arrived, and
there were also present a few more young people,
particular friends of Lulu's, who had been
invited to join the Club.</p>

<p>"I want you to meet my friend, Betty Randall,"
Lulu said to Marjorie, as Elsie turned away
to speak to other friends. "She's English, and
just as nice as can be. She and her mother and
brother are visiting us. She can't be a member,
because they are all going back to England next
week, but she and Jack are the special guests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of the evening, and they are both to be allowed
to vote on the poems."</p>

<p>Betty Randall was a quiet, sweet-faced girl of
fifteen, and Marjorie liked her at once.</p>

<p>"Have you been in this country long?" she
asked, when Lulu had left them together, and
gone to greet other arriving guests. She could
not help feeling a good deal interested in meeting
"a real English girl."</p>

<p>"Only since September," Betty answered,
"but we used to live in New York. My mother
is English, but she and my father came to this
country when they were married, and my brother
and I were both born in New York. We lived
here until four years ago, when my uncle took
us back to England to live with him."</p>

<p>"I should think it would be wonderfully interesting
to live in England," said Marjorie. "I
suppose of course you have been in London, and
seen the Tower and Westminster Abbey?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Betty, smiling. "One of my
uncle's places is quite near London, and we often
motor into town. I like America, though; it
always seems more like home. Do you know the
names of all these girls?"</p>

<p>"I know most of them; we go to the same
school, but I haven't been in New York nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
as long as you have. My home is in Arizona,
and I have only come here to spend the winter,
and go to school with my cousin."</p>

<p>Betty looked a little disappointed.</p>

<p>"Then I suppose you can't tell me something
I want to know very much," she said. "Lulu
told me Dr. Randolph's nephew was to be here,
and I do want to see him."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can point him out to you," said Marjorie.
"He lives at the Plaza, where my uncle
has an apartment, and Elsie and I know him very
well. There he is, that tall boy, who has just
come in. Isn't he handsome?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very," agreed Betty, regarding the new
arrival with considerable interest. "I never met
him, but his uncle was such a good friend to us
once."</p>

<p>"I know Dr. Randolph, too," said Marjorie;
"he took us to New Haven in his car to see the
game last Saturday. He is very kind."</p>

<p>"Kind!" repeated Betty, with shining eyes;
"he is more than kind, he is wonderful. He
cured my brother, and made him walk, when he
had been a cripple all his life."</p>

<p>Marjorie gave a little gasp, and some of the
color went out of her face.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," she said, clasping her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
hands, and regarding her new acquaintance with
such an eager expression in her eyes, that Betty
was quite startled.</p>

<p>"It was before we went back to England," she
said. "We were living here in New York, and
Winifred Hamilton and her father and mother
had an apartment in the same house. My
mother was taken very ill, and Winifred went
for Lulu Bell's father, whom you know is a
doctor. He was very good to us, and while attending
mother he became very much interested
in my brother, who was nine years old then, and
had never walked a step since he was born. He
brought Dr. Randolph to see Jack, and he felt
sure something could be done for him, and persuaded
Mother to let him be taken to a hospital.
Mother consented, and Dr. Randolph performed
a wonderful operation."</p>

<p>"And does your brother walk now?" Marjorie
asked almost breathlessly.</p>

<p>"There he is," said Betty, smiling, and pointing
to a tall boy of thirteen, who was standing
near the door, talking to Winifred Hamilton.
"You would never believe that he was a helpless
cripple only four years ago, would you?"
she added proudly.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said Marjorie; "it seems very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
wonderful. Do you suppose Dr. Randolph often
performs such operations?"</p>

<p>"I think so. Dr. Bell says he is one of the
finest surgeons in the country. Why are you so
much interested? Do you know some one who
is a cripple, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Marjorie, with a sigh. "It's my
aunt; she had a terrible accident eight years ago,
and has never walked since. But she is away in
Arizona; we could never ask Dr. Randolph to
go all that distance to see her."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not," Betty admitted regretfully,
"but couldn't your aunt be brought here
to him? I know people come from all parts of
the country to consult him. There was a little
girl at the hospital when Jack was there, who
had been brought all the way from Texas."</p>

<p>Marjorie thought of the long three-days journey,
and of her father's desperate struggle to
make both ends meet, but before she could
answer, Lulu, as mistress of ceremonies&mdash;rapped
sharply on the table, and the Club was
called to order.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>ELSIE TRIUMPHS</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Ladies</span> and gentlemen," began Lulu, speaking
in the tone she had heard her mother use
when conducting a meeting of a charitable board
of which she was president, "I think every one
is now here, and I must request you all please
to keep quiet during the reading of the poems.
After the reading, votes will be taken as to the
best poem, and the girl who gets the most votes
will be elected president of this Club. The boys
are particularly requested not to laugh at any
of the poems. The first to be read is by Miss
Winifred Hamilton, and is called 'Ria and the
Bear.' Miss Hamilton wishes me to explain that
she has never heard the name Ria, but chose it
because it was the only word she could think of
that rhymed with fear."</p>

<p>There was a general titter from the audience,
followed by a burst of applause, as Winifred,
very red, and looking as if she were being led to
execution, rose and announced:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's perfectly awful, but it's the first poem
I ever wrote in my life, and I want to say that
I sha'n't be in the least offended if everybody
laughs." Then, unfolding a small sheet of paper,
she began to read very fast.</p>

<div class='center'><br />"<span class="smcap">Ria And The Bear.</span><br /></div>
<div class='poem'>

<br />
"The sky was of the darkest hue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The grass beneath was wet with dew,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And through the trees the wind did howl,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Causing the hungry bears to growl.</span><br />
<br />
"All were protected from the storm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">All but one wee, shivering form,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She stood beneath an old elm tree,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The boughs of which from leaves were free.</span><br />
<br />
"A big bear darted through the wood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">His instinct told him where she stood.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Soon the monster came close to Ria,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But the child showed no sign of fear.</span><br />
<br />
"As the big bear drew very close,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She gave a pat to his cold nose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">At this touch the bear did cease to growl,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And for response a joyful howl.</span><br />
<br />
"Then these two friends lay down together,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Quite heedless of the raging weather,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Upon the hard and frozen ground,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The two friends slept, both very sound.</span><br />
<br />
"But one of the two never awoke;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Long, long after the wind storm broke,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">She was discovered lying there,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where she had died beside the bear."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Bravo! Winifred, that's fine!" shouted Jack
Randall, and then followed a shout of laughter,
in which everybody joined, Winifred herself as
heartily as any of the others.</p>

<p>"I told you it was awful," she said between
gasps, "but Lulu said no one could be a member
who didn't write a poem, so I had to do my
best."</p>

<p>"I should die of mortification if I were
laughed at like that," whispered Elsie to Carol,
who sat next to her. To which her friend replied
sympathetically:</p>

<p>"Of course you would, but then everybody
isn't a genius like you."</p>

<p>"The next poem," announced Lulu, when order
had been restored, "is by Miss Marjorie
Graham of Arizona. Get up, Marjorie."</p>

<p>Marjorie's heart was beating rather fast as
she rose, but there was a merry twinkle in her
eye, and if her voice shook a little when she began
to read, it was more from suppressed laughter
than from fear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>



<div class='center'>"<span class="smcap">The Boring Life of New York.</span><br /></div>

<div class='poem'><br />
"Some think it delightful to live in New York,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But with them I do not agree;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Tis nothing but hustle and bustle and talk,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">All very distasteful to me.</span><br />
<br />
"I love all the pleasures the country can give,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The beautiful flowers and the birds;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The city produces not one of these things,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Only traffic and crowds by the herds.</span><br />
<br />
"The city is good as a workshop for men,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Who in parks idle moments may pass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But the pleasure for children e'en there is quite spoiled,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When a sign bids them 'Keep off the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Glass'">Grass</ins>.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>A burst of genuine applause followed this production,
and Marjorie sat down again quite covered
with confusion.</p>

<p>"It's splendid; I couldn't have written anything
half so good," whispered Betty encouragingly.
"I am rather glad I am not to be a member
of the Club, for I know I could never have
written two lines that rhymed."</p>

<p>"The next poem," continued Lulu, in her business-like
tone, "is by Miss Gertrude Rossiter,"
and Gertie, looking very much embarrassed, rose,
and began:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>



<div class='center'>"<span class="smcap">The Storm at Sea.</span><br /></div>
<div class='poem'><br />
"The waves did beat on a rocky shore;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The noise resounded more and more;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A little craft was tossed on the sea,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And all knew that saved she might not be.</span><br />
<br />
"The crew were gathered on the deck,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Awaiting the crash of the awful wreck;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Many hearts stopped beating as the time drew near</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To bid good-bye to their children dear.</span><br />
<br />
"The babies and children all did shriek,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And now their voices grew very weak.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The staunch big men grew white with fear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">At the thought of death that was so near.</span><br />
<br />
"But all at once the winds did cease,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The waves stopped tossing, and there was peace,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The children stopped crying; with joy they all laughed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And gladness prevailed on that safe little craft."</span><br />
</div>

<p>There was more applause, mingled with laughter,
and Elsie whispered to Carol, quite loud
enough to be heard by several others:</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear anything so silly? Even
the meter is wrong; there are too many words
in some lines, and not enough in others."</p>

<p>"Read yours next, Lulu," said Winifred, before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
her friend could make another announcement.
"Lulu writes beautiful poetry," she
added in a lower tone to Jack Randall; "I'm
crazy to know what she's written this time."</p>

<p>Lulu protested that as hostess her turn should
come last, but several other girls joined their entreaties
to Winifred's, and she was forced to
yield. Blushing and smiling, she took a sheet
of paper from her pocket, and began to read:</p>

<div class='center'>
"<span class="smcap">The Fire.</span><br /></div>
<div class='poem'><br />
"The forest trees were waving in the wind;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The sun was slowly sinking o'er the hill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The clouds in purple, gold and blue outlined,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Were mirrored in the still pond by the mill.</span><br />
<br />
"The birds were twittering their last good-night;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The dainty flow'rets closing up their eyes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When all at once a fearful lurid light</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Shone in the many-colored sunset skies.</span><br />
<br />
"Quickly that awe-inspiring fire spread,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And many a tall and stately tree there fell.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The timid animals and birds all fled,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And naught but charred remains were left the tale to tell.</span><br />
<br />
"At morn when in his glory rose the sun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Over the blackened, devastated hill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The scene that there the traveler looked upon</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Seemed to his inmost heart to send a chill."</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't she wonderful?" whispered Winifred
excitedly to Jack. "I told you hers would be
the best."</p>

<p>"It's very pretty," Jack admitted, "but I
think I like the one about Ria and the Bear the
best of all."</p>

<p>"The next poem," announced Lulu, when the
applause had subsided, "is by Miss Elsie Carleton."</p>

<p>There was a little flutter of excitement as
Elsie rose&mdash;as the brightest girl in the school, a
good deal was expected of her. Some of the
girls noticed with surprise, that Elsie had grown
rather pale, but her voice was as calm and superior
as ever, when she unfolded her paper, and
began:</p>

<div class='center'>
"GOD KNOWS.<br />
</div>
<div class='poem'><br />
"Oh, wild and dark was the winter's night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When the emigrant ship went down,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But just outside the harbor bar,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the sight of the startled town.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the wind howled, and the sea roared,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And never a soul could sleep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Save the little ones on their mothers' breasts,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Too young to watch and weep.</span><br />
<br />
"No boat could live in that angry surf,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">No rope could reach the land&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There were bold, brave hearts upon the shore;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">There was many a helping hand;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Men who strove, and women who prayed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Till work and prayer were vain;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the sun rose over that awful void,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the silence of the main.</span><br />
<br />
"All day the watchers paced the sand;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">All day they scanned the deep;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">All night the booming minute guns</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Echoed from steep to steep.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">'Give up thy dead, oh cruel sea!'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They cried athwart the space,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But only a baby's fragile form</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Escaped from its stern embrace.</span><br />
<br />
"Only one little child of all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Who with the ship went down,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That night while the happy babies slept</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">All warm in the sheltered town.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There in the glow of the morning light</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">It lay on the shifting sand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pure as a sculptor's marble dream,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With a shell in its dimpled hand.</span><br />
<br />
"There were none to tell of its race or kin&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">'God knows,' the pastor said,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When the sobbing children crowded to ask</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The name of the baby dead.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And so when they laid it away at last,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In the churchyard's hushed repose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">They raised a slab at the baby's head,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With the carven words 'God knows.'"</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a general murmur of admiration, as
Elsie sat down again, in the midst of a burst of
applause louder than had greeted any of the other
productions.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it lovely?" whispered Winifred to
Jack, as she wiped her eyes. "I do love those
sad pieces, don't you?"</p>

<p>"They're all right," said Jack, a little doubtfully,
"but don't you like the funny ones that
make you laugh, better? Ria and the Bear was
so funny."</p>

<p>"That poem is really beautiful," declared
Betty Randall, turning to Marjorie, and speaking
in a tone of hearty admiration. "She must
be an awfully clever girl to have written it; it's
quite good enough to be published."</p>

<p>But Marjorie did not answer. She had given
one violent start when Elsie began the first line
of her poem, and at the same moment she had
caught the expression on Beverly Randolph's
face. After that she had sat quite still, with
crimson cheeks, and a heart that was beating so
loudly she was almost afraid people must hear
it. In her mind was a mild confusion of feelings;
astonishment, mortification, and incredulity,
and, worst of all, the knowledge that at least one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
other person in the room besides herself knew.
When the burst of applause came she was conscious
of a momentary sensation of relief. At
least no one was going to speak yet. She cast
an imploring glance at Beverly, but his face expressed
nothing beyond amusement and a sort of
indifferent contempt.</p>

<p>There were more poems read; some funny,
some sentimental; but Marjorie scarcely heard
them. In her thoughts there was room but for
one thing. Even the wonderful story Betty
had told about her brother and Dr. Randolph
was swept away in the shock of the discovery
she had made. Several times she glanced at
Elsie, fully expecting to see some expression of
shame or remorse but that young lady was looking
the picture of smiling content.</p>

<p>When the poems had all been read, there was
a general move, and pencils and bits of paper
were handed around.</p>

<p>"One of the boys will pass round a hat," Lulu
explained, "and you must all drop your votes
into it." Then, with a sudden generous impulse,
she went up to Elsie and held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Yours was ever so much the best, Elsie,"
she said, frankly; "you certainly deserve to be
president."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Elsie just touched the outstretched hand with
the tips of her fingers, and for one moment her
eyes dropped and her color deepened.</p>

<p>There was a moment of dead silence while the
names were being written, then Gertie Rossiter's
brother passed round the hat, and each girl and
boy dropped a bit of paper into it.</p>

<p>"I shall vote for Elsie Carleton, sha'n't you?"
whispered Betty to Marjorie, but Marjorie shook
her head.</p>

<p>"I am going to vote for Lulu Bell," she said
shortly.</p>

<p>It was an exciting moment when Beverly Randolph
and Rob Rossiter&mdash;the two oldest boys
present&mdash;counted the votes and announced the
results: "Elsie Carleton, thirteen. Lulu Bell,
nine. Marjorie Graham, five. Gertie Rossiter,
three, and Winifred Hamilton, one."</p>

<p>The presidency of the Club was unanimously
accorded to Elsie.</p>

<p>Then came an hour of games and dancing, followed
at half-past nine, by light refreshments.
But although Marjorie entered into the gayety
with the rest, her heart was very heavy, and she
did not join in the congratulations which were
being showered upon the new president, in which
even Lulu's mother and aunt, who had come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
downstairs as soon as the initiation was over,
joined heartily. Beverly Randolph was a general
favorite, and devoted himself in turn to almost
every girl in the room, but he, too, held
aloof from the new president. He and Marjorie
had no opportunity for private conversation till
the refreshments were being served, when he
approached her corner, with a plate of ice-cream.</p>

<p>"Your 'Boring Life of New York' was fine,"
he remarked, pleasantly, taking the vacant chair
by her side. "I quite agree with your sentiment.
I voted for you."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," said Marjorie, blushing,
"but it wasn't nearly as good as several of the
others. Lulu's was splendid. You&mdash;you
didn't like Elsie's?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," said Beverly bluntly, "and
you didn't, either."</p>

<p>Marjorie's cheeks were crimson, but she made
one desperate effort to save her cousin.</p>

<p>"It was a beautiful little poem," she faltered,
"only&mdash;only I thought&mdash;but perhaps I was
mistaken&mdash;I'm sure Elsie wouldn't have done
such a thing; it must have been a mistake."</p>

<p>Beverly said nothing, but he did not look convinced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where&mdash;where did you see it before?"
Marjorie went on desperately.</p>

<p>"In an old volume of 'St. Nicholas' at home.
My mother used to take the magazine when she
was a little girl, and has all the volumes bound.
I used to be very fond of some of the old stories,
and so was my sister Barbara. I remember she
learned that poem once to recite to Mother on
her birthday."</p>

<p>Marjorie's heart sank like lead. Well did she
remember the old worn volumes of St. Nicholas&mdash;relics
of her own mother's childhood&mdash;over
which she had pored on many a rainy day at
home. She cast an appealing glance at Beverly.</p>

<p>"You won't tell?" she said unsteadily.</p>

<p>"Of course I won't; I'm not a cad. And look
here, Marjorie; I wouldn't bother my head about
it if I were you. Miss Elsie is quite able to fight
her own battles."</p>

<p>"But she is my cousin," said Marjorie in a
very low voice, "and I'm so ashamed."</p>

<p>Beverly's face softened, and his voice was very
kind when he answered:</p>

<p>"You're a brick, Marjorie; lots of girls
wouldn't care. But don't let it make you unhappy.
If I were you I'd have it out with Elsie;
perhaps she'll have some excuse to offer."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Before Marjorie could answer Lulu came up
to ask Beverly to come and be introduced to
Betty Randall, who was particularly anxious to
meet him, and he was obliged to hurry away.</p>

<p>"What were you and that English girl talking
about so long?" Elsie inquired, as she and Marjorie
were driving home together half an hour
later.</p>

<p>Marjorie roused herself from uncomfortable
reflections with a start.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing in particular," she said, "at
least nothing you would be interested in. She
was telling me about her brother, who used to be
a cripple till Beverly Randolph's uncle cured him.
He is a fine, strong-looking boy now&mdash;did you
notice him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Did you know their uncle was a lord?"</p>

<p>"Is he?" said Marjorie indifferently, and once
more relapsed into silence. Elsie regarded her
cousin in evident surprise.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Marjorie?" she inquired
curiously. "You seem to be in the dumps, and
I'm sure I can't see why. You really danced
much better than I supposed you could. You're
not jealous, are you?"</p>

<p>"Jealous," repeated Marjorie, stupidly, "what
about?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, your poem, of course, because you
didn't get more votes. It really wasn't bad; I
heard several of the girls say so."</p>

<p>"Of course I wasn't jealous," said Marjorie,
indignantly. "I never dreamed of getting many
votes. I think people were very kind to vote for
me at all; it was just silly doggerel."</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't fly into a temper even if
you're not jealous," laughed Elsie. "Do you
know you never congratulated me on my poem.
I think people thought it rather queer, when every
one was saying how much they liked it."</p>

<p>"I couldn't," said Marjorie in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded Elsie, sharply. She
was evidently startled but beyond a slightly
heightened color, she showed no sign of embarrassment.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when we get home," whispered
Marjorie, with a glance at Hortense, who was
sitting in the opposite seat.</p>

<p>Not another word was spoken until the carriage
drew up before the big hotel. Mr. and
Mrs. Carleton were out, and the girls went at
once to their rooms, without exchanging the
usual good-nights. Marjorie's heart was beating
painfully fast, and her cheeks were burning,
but she did not waver in her determination to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
"have it out" with Elsie before they went to
bed. So instead of beginning to undress, she
sat down to wait until Hortense should have
finished waiting on her cousin and gone away.
She had, with some difficulty, at last succeeded in
convincing the maid that she did not require assistance
herself.</p>

<p>"Elsie will be terribly angry," she told herself
mournfully, "and it will be very horrid and uncomfortable,
but it wouldn't be honest not to let
her know I recognized that poem. Perhaps she
can explain&mdash;oh, I do hope she can&mdash;and then
I can tell Beverly, and everything will be all right
again."</p>

<p>She heard the outer door close behind Hortense,
and was just about to go to her cousin's
room, when her door was pushed unceremoniously
open and Elsie herself came in. Elsie's
cheeks were flushed, and her eyes were flashing,
but whether with anger or excitement Marjorie
could not tell.</p>

<p>"Well," she began in a tone which she evidently
intended to be quite cheerful and indifferent,
"I've gotten rid of Hortense. She seemed
to think she ought to stay till Papa and Mamma
came home, but I told her we didn't need her.
Now you can tell me what you said you would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
when we got home. Do be quick about it,
though, for I'm awfully sleepy, and I want to
go to bed."</p>

<p>Before answering Marjorie went over to her
cousin's side, and laid a timid hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Elsie," she said gently, "I'm so sorry; I hate
to say it, but I've got to. It's&mdash;about that
poem; I've read it before. You didn't think you
really made it up, did you?"</p>

<p>With an angry gesture Elsie pushed away her
cousin's hand.</p>

<p>"Of course I made it up," she said angrily;
"how dare you say I didn't? I don't believe
you ever saw a poem like it before in
your life; you only say so because you're
jealous."</p>

<p>"Oh, Elsie, how can you say such dreadful
things?" cried poor Marjorie, clasping her hands
in her distress, and on the verge of tears. "How
could I possibly be jealous of any one so much
cleverer than myself? I've been so proud of
you, Elsie&mdash;indeed, indeed I have&mdash;but I read
that poem in an old 'St. Nicholas' at home. I
remembered it because it was so pretty. Beverly
Randolph remembers it, too; he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Beverly Randolph!" cried Elsie, her eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
flashing ominously; "so you told him about it,
did you? That accounts for his not congratulating
me when all the others did. Marjorie
Graham, you are the meanest, most contemptible
girl I have ever known. To think of your doing
such a thing after all Papa and Mamma have
done for you! But if you suppose for one moment
that any one is going to take your word
against mine, you'll find yourself very much mistaken.
I shall write a note to Beverly Randolph
to-morrow. A nice opinion he must have of you
already&mdash;boys hate sneaks."</p>

<p>"I'm not a sneak," retorted Marjorie, her own
eyes beginning to flash. "I wouldn't have told
Beverly Randolph or any one else such a thing
for the world; I would have been ashamed to
have them know. He recognized the poem, too.
I saw he did the minute you began to read&mdash;and
afterwards he spoke of it. But he won't
tell; he promised not to, and&mdash;oh, Elsie I
thought you might be able to explain it in some
way."</p>

<p>"There isn't anything to explain," said Elsie,
obstinately. "If you and that horrid Randolph
boy choose to say wicked things about me you
can, but you are not everybody, and when my
friends hear about it I think they'll have something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
to say." And without another word, Elsie
walked out of the room, slamming the door behind her,
and her cousin was left to cry herself
to sleep undisturbed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>THE THINGS THAT HURT</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Marjorie</span> awoke the next morning with a
very heavy heart. Although Elsie's companionship
had not proved quite all she had anticipated,
still they had hitherto been perfectly good friends.
Marjorie had looked upon her clever cousin with
genuine admiration, and if in some things Elsie
had disappointed her, she had explained the fact
to herself by remembering how different life in
New York was from life in Arizona.</p>

<p>"Elsie has so many friends," she had told herself
over and over again; "of course I can't expect
her to be as fond of me as I am of her."</p>

<p>But last night's discovery had been a cruel disappointment,
and her cousin's parting words had
hurt more than perhaps Elsie herself fully
realized. She had lain awake a long time, hoping&mdash;almost
expecting&mdash;that Elsie would
come back to tell her she was sorry. She was
so ready to forgive, herself, and even to make allowances,
but no sound had come from the adjoining room,
and she had fallen asleep at last,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
still hoping that morning might bring about the
longed-for reconciliation.</p>

<p>It was still very early, but accustomed all her
life to the early hours of the ranch, she had not
yet learned to sleep as late as the other members
of the family. She tossed about in bed for
half an hour, vainly trying to go to sleep again,
and then suddenly determined to get up.</p>

<p>"If I could only have a canter on Roland, or
a good long tramp before breakfast," she thought,
with a regretful sigh, "I know it would clear the
cobwebs from my brain, and I should feel ever
so much better. But since that is out of the
question, I may as well answer Undine's letter.
She will like a letter all to herself, and I shall
have plenty of time to write before the others are
up."</p>

<p>Accordingly, as soon as she was dressed, she
sat down at her desk, and began a letter, which
she was determined to make as bright and cheerful
as possible.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'>

"<span class="smcap">New York</span>, November 28th.<br />
</div>

"<span class="smcap">Dear Undine</span>:

<p>"I was delighted to get your nice letter last
week, but this is the very first spare moment I
have had in which to answer it. It is still very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
early&mdash;only a little after six&mdash;and nobody else
is up, but I can't get accustomed to the queer
New York hours. Just think, nobody has breakfast
much before half past eight, and instead of
dinner at twelve or one, we don't dine till half
past seven. I thought I should be dreadfully
hungry when I first heard at what hour New
York people dined, but really luncheon&mdash;which
they have in the middle of the day&mdash;is almost
the same as dinner. I have eaten so much since
I came here that I am sure I must have gained
pounds already.</p>

<p>"I wrote Father all about the football game,
and what a wonderful day I had. Since then
we have had Thanksgiving, and that was very
pleasant too, though of course not as exciting as
the football match and the motor ride. We all
dined with Aunt Julia's sister, Mrs. Lamont.
Mrs. Lamont's son, who is an artist, and very
clever, drew funny sketches on all the dinner
cards, and his sister made up the verses. I
think my card was lovely; it had a picture of a
girl riding a horse, and the verse underneath was:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Welcome, Western stranger<br />
To our Thanksgiving board,<br />
May you have a jolly time,<br />
And not be very bored.'<br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Annie says she isn't a poet, and I don't
suppose any of the verses were really very good,
but they made everybody laugh. It was funny
to have 'board' and 'bored' in the same verse,
but Miss Lamont said she got hopelessly stuck
when she had written the first two lines, and had
to end up with 'bored,' because it was the only
word she could think of to rhyme with 'the
Thanksgiving board.' I sat next to Mr. Ward&mdash;Aunt
Julia's other sister's husband&mdash;and he
was very kind, and told funny stories all the time.
After dinner we had charades, and played old-fashioned
games, which were great fun.</p>

<p>"<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Luly'">Lulu</ins> Bell, one of the girls at school, has
gotten up a Club, which is to meet every Friday
evening at the different girls' houses. We had
the first meeting last night, and every girl had
to write a poem in order to become a member.
Some of the poems were very clever, and some
very funny. One girl made 'close' rhyme with
'nose.' My poem was silly, but I am going to
send it to Aunt Jessie, because she likes to keep
all my foolish little things.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you are happy, and are growing
so fond of Mother and Aunt Jessie. The
more people I meet, the more convinced I am
that they are the two of the very best in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
world. I am glad, too, that you are trying not
to worry about the things you can't remember.
I have told the girls at school about you, and
they all think you are the most wonderful person
they have ever heard of. The lady who
took me to the football game had a little girl
who was killed in the San Francisco earthquake.
Her brother told me about it, and it is a very
sad story. He asked me not to mention you to
his mother, because it always distresses her to
hear anything about the earthquake. She is
perfectly lovely, and so bright and jolly that it
seems hard to realize she has had such a great
sorrow, but her son says that is because she is
so unselfish, and is always thinking of other people.
Isn't it wonderful how many brave, unselfish
people there are in the world?</p>

<p>"I have met a surgeon. He is the gentleman
in whose car we went to New Haven last
Saturday, and he is just as nice and kind as he
can be. He is very clever too, and has performed
some wonderful operations, but oh, Undine
dear, I am afraid I shall never have the
courage to speak to him about Aunt Jessie. Arizona
is so far away, and it would be so terribly
presumptuous to even suggest the possibility of
a great surgeon's taking such a journey to see a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
person he didn't even know. Still, if it could
only happen&mdash;I pray about it every day.</p>

<p>"I must stop writing now, and study a little
before breakfast. Be sure to write again very
soon, and don't forget to give me every scrap of
news about every one and everything. Kiss
Roland's dear soft nose for me, and tell him not
to forget his old mistress. Heaps of love and
kisses for everybody, with a good share for
yourself thrown in, from</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"Your true friend,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Marjorie Graham.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>When Elsie entered the sitting-room, she
found her uncle and cousin already at the breakfast
table. Mrs. Carleton had a headache, and
was breakfasting in bed. Mr. Carleton's morning
greeting was as pleasant and affectionate as
usual, but Elsie merely vouchsafed a slight nod,
and a muttered "good-morning," and then kept
her eyes steadily on her plate, as though to avoid
any friendly overtures on Marjorie's part.</p>

<p>"What are you little girls going to do to-day?"
Mr. Carleton inquired pleasantly, as he
rose from the table.</p>

<p>"I'm going to dancing-school this morning,"
said Elsie, "and then to lunch with Carol."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Carlton glanced inquiringly at Marjorie.</p>

<p>"And you?" he asked kindly&mdash;"are you going
to dancing-school, too?"</p>

<p>Marjorie hesitated, and her color rose. It
had been suggested that she should accompany
Elsie to the dancing class that morning, and that
Aunt Julia should make arrangements about having
her admitted as a regular pupil, but after
what had happened last night she did not
feel at all sure that Elsie would desire her
society.</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm not quite sure," she faltered; "I
think Aunt Julia may want me to go out with
her."</p>

<p>Mr. Carleton looked a little troubled, and when
he left the room he beckoned his daughter to follow
him.</p>

<p>"Elsie dear," he said in a rather low voice, as
he put on his overcoat in the entry, "I wish you
would try to do something to give Marjorie a
good time to-day. She is looking rather down-hearted
this morning, and I'm afraid she may be
a little homesick. Can't you arrange to take her
out to luncheon with you?"</p>

<p>Elsie shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"She hasn't been invited," she said, shortly.
She did not think it necessary to add that Carol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Hastings had proposed that Marjorie should
make one of the party, but that she herself had
opposed the plan, declaring that they would have
a much pleasanter time by themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. Carleton frowned.</p>

<p>"I should think you knew Carol Hastings well
enough to ask her if you might bring Marjorie
with you," he said impatiently. "Remember,
Elsie, what I have told you several times before;
I won't have Marjorie neglected."</p>

<p>Now it was rather unfortunate that Mr. Carleton
should have chosen just this particular time
for reminding his daughter of her duty. As a
rule, his words would have produced the desired
effect, for Elsie stood considerably in awe of her
father, but just at present she was very angry
with Marjorie, and this admonition only made
her angrier still.</p>

<p>"Marjorie is all right," she said, sulkily;
"she manages to have a good time wherever she
goes. If you knew as much about her as I do
you wouldn't worry for fear she might be neglected."</p>

<p>Mr. Carleton did not look satisfied, but he had
an appointment to keep, and there was no time
for argument, so, after giving his daughter a
good-bye kiss, and telling her to be an unselfish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
little girl, he hurried away, and had soon forgotten
the incident in the interest of more important
matters.</p>

<p>Elsie did not go back to the parlor, but went at
once to her mother's room, where she remained
for some time with the door closed. Marjorie,
having finished her breakfast, wandered aimlessly
over to the window, where she stood looking
down at the crowds of people and vehicles in the
street below. It was a lovely morning and, early
as it was, the park seemed full of children.
Some had already mounted their ponies, and
others were on roller skates or bicycles. How
Marjorie longed to join them, but going out
alone was strictly forbidden. She was feeling
very unhappy, and more homesick than at any
time since coming to New York.</p>

<p>"I must get something to do or I shall make a
goose of myself and begin to cry," she said desperately,
and picking up the first book she found
on the table, she plunged into it haphazard, and
when Elsie returned she found her cousin to all
appearances quite absorbed in "The Letters of
Queen Victoria."</p>

<p>Elsie did not speak, but seating herself at the
piano, began practicing exercises as if her life depended
on it. Marjorie closed her book, and sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
watching her cousin in silence for several minutes;
then she spoke.</p>

<p>"Elsie."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" inquired Elsie, wheeling
round on the piano stool.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to be friends with me?"</p>

<p>"I certainly am not unless you intend to apologize
for the outrageous things you said to me last
night. I've been telling Mamma about it, and
she is very angry."</p>

<p>Marjorie rose.</p>

<p>"I can't apologize, Elsie; you know I can't,"
she said, steadily, and without another word she
turned and left the room.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Carleton entered her niece's room
an hour later, she found Marjorie curled up in a
little disconsolate heap on the bed, her face buried
in the pillows. Aunt Julia was still in her
morning wrapper, and was looking decidedly
worried.</p>

<p>"Marjorie," she began in a rather fretful tone,
as she closed the door, and sank wearily into the
arm-chair, "I am very much distressed by what
Elsie tells me. I have come to ask you what it
all means."</p>

<p>Marjorie raised a swollen, tear-stained face
from the pillows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"What has Elsie told you?" she inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton pressed her hand to her forehead.</p>

<p>"O dear!" she sighed, "my head aches so this
morning, and I do dislike all these quarrels and
arguments. I did hope you and Elsie would get
on together without quarreling."</p>

<p>"I don't want to quarrel," protested Marjorie;
"what does Elsie say about me?"</p>

<p>"She says you have been very unkind and unjust
to her. She won't tell me what it is all
about. I tried to make her tell, but Elsie is so
honorable; she hates tale-bearing. But I know
you have hurt her pride, and made her very unhappy."</p>

<p>Marjorie was silent; what could she say?
And after a moment her aunt went on in her
fretful, complaining voice.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you have the least idea what
a noble, splendid girl Elsie is. It was rather
hard for her at first when she heard you were
coming to spend the winter, for of course it
couldn't help making some difference. She has
never had to share anything with any one else
before. But she was so sweet and unselfish
about it, and I did hope things might go on as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
they had begun. But now you have begun to
quarrel, and I suppose there will be nothing but
trouble and unpleasantness all winter."</p>

<p>"She was so sweet and unselfish about it!"
How those words hurt Marjorie, and all the time
she had been thinking that Elsie had looked forward
to meeting her almost, if not quite as much,
as she had looked forward to knowing the cousin
who was "the next best thing to a sister." It
was only by a mighty effort that she managed to
choke back the flood of scalding tears, which
threatened to overwhelm her.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, Aunt Julia," she said tremulously;
"I didn't mean to quarrel with Elsie. If
she had told you what it was about perhaps you
would have understood."</p>

<p>"Well, she wouldn't tell," said Mrs. Carleton,
crossly, "so there is no use in talking about that.
All I want to say to you is that I am very much
annoyed, and sincerely hope nothing so unpleasant
will happen again. Elsie has gone to dancing-school,
and Hortense has gone with her, as
my head was so bad. Now I am going back to
my room to lie down for a while; perhaps I may
be better by luncheon time."</p>

<p>That was the most unhappy day Marjorie had
ever spent in her life. It seemed to her as if the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
morning would never end, and when her aunt appeared
at luncheon she still wore an air of injured
dignity, and entertained Marjorie during
the meal, with a long account of Elsie's many accomplishments,
a subject of which her niece was
becoming heartily tired, although she would
scarcely have admitted the fact even to herself.
Soon after luncheon Mr. Carleton telephoned to
say that he would come uptown in time to drive
with his wife, and Aunt Julia proposed that Marjorie
should go for a walk with Hortense. The
girl's own head was aching by this time, and she
was glad of a brisk walk in the keen, frosty air,
but she was so unusually silent and preoccupied,
that the maid asked her anxiously if she "had the
homesickness."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Marjorie, with a catch in her
voice, "I've got it badly to-day."</p>

<p>"Ah, I understand," murmured Hortense,
softly, "Mademoiselle is like me&mdash;I, too, often
have the homesickness."</p>

<p>Elsie did not reach home till after five, as
Carol's mother had taken the two girls to the
theater, and even then she took no notice of Marjorie,
but went at once to her mother's room,
where Marjorie heard her giving a long and animated
account of the play she had seen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"By the way," remarked Mr. Carleton at dinner
that evening, "I forgot to ask about the Club&mdash;how
did the poems turn out?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's embarrassed silence, and
Marjorie's heart began to beat very fast; then
Elsie spoke.</p>

<p>"They were all very silly," she said, indifferently.
"I told Lulu it was nonsense having all
the girls write poems."</p>

<p>"Whose poem was the best?" Mr. Carleton
asked.</p>

<p>"They made me president of the Club," said
Elsie, her eyes bent on her plate; "my poem got
the most votes."</p>

<p>"I was sure it would," murmured Mrs. Carleton,
with an adoring glance at her clever daughter.
"Why didn't you tell us about it before,
darling&mdash;you knew how interested we would
be?"</p>

<p>"Let me see the poem," said Mr. Carleton,
good-naturedly; "I should like to judge its merits
for myself."</p>

<p>"I can't; I've torn it up." Elsie tried to speak
in a tone of complete indifference, but her
cheeks were crimson, and her father watched her
curiously.</p>

<p>"My darling child, how very foolish!" remonstrated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Mrs. Carleton. "You know your
father and I always want to see everything
you write. Why in the world did you tear it
up?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it wasn't any good," said Elsie, with an
uneasy glance at Marjorie; "some of the girls
thought Lulu's poem was better."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it was, though," Mrs. Carleton
maintained with conviction. "Wasn't Elsie's
poem much the best, Marjorie?"</p>

<p>It was a dreadful moment for poor Marjorie.
She had never told a lie in her life, and yet how
could she offend her uncle and aunt, who were
doing so much for her, and who both adored
Elsie? She cast an appealing glance at her
cousin, and remained silent.</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't ask Marjorie," remarked
Elsie, with a disagreeable laugh; "she doesn't
like my poem. She only got five votes herself, so
I suppose it's rather hard for her to judge of
other people's poetry."</p>

<p>Mr. Carleton frowned, and Mrs. Carleton
looked distressed, but no more was said on the
subject, for which Marjorie felt sincerely thankful.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, and the most unhappy,
homesick day Marjorie had spent in New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
York. Her uncle was the only member of the
family who continued to treat her as usual. Elsie
scarcely spoke to her, and Aunt Julia, though
evidently making an effort to be kind, showed so
plainly by her manner that she was both hurt and
displeased, that poor Marjorie's heart grew
heavier and heavier. They all went to church in
the morning, and in the afternoon Elsie went for
a drive with her mother, and Mr. Carleton retired
to his own room to read and write letters.
Marjorie began her usual home letter, but had
not written half a page when she broke down,
and spent the next half hour in having a good
cry, which was perhaps the most satisfactory
thing she could have done under the circumstances.</p>

<p>She had just dried her eyes, and having made
a brave resolution not to be so foolish again, was
sitting down with the intention of going on with
her letter, when she heard her uncle's voice calling
her from the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Come here, Marjorie," said Mr. Carleton,
kindly, as his niece appeared in answer to his
summons. "Sit down and let us have a little
talk before the others come home."</p>

<p>Marjorie complied. She hoped devoutly that
her uncle would not notice that she had been crying,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
but perhaps Uncle Henry's eyes were
sharper than his family always suspected.</p>

<p>"Marjorie," he said abruptly, "I want you to
tell me what this trouble is between you and
Elsie."</p>

<p>Marjorie gave a little gasp, and her cheeks
grew pink.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm afraid I can't tell you, Uncle
Henry," she faltered; "you had better ask
Elsie."</p>

<p>"I have asked her, and so has your aunt, but
she refused to tell us anything except that you
have quarreled about something, and that you
have treated her rather unkindly."</p>

<p>Marjorie's eyes flashed indignantly, and she bit
her lips to keep back the angry words.</p>

<p>"Now I happen to know a good deal about
these little quarrels of Elsie's," Mr. Carleton went
on quietly. "She is a good girl, and a clever
one, too, but she has her faults and I have no reason
to suppose that you are any more to blame
than she in this case. All I want is a clear account
of what happened, and then I can settle
this tempest in a teapot, which I can see has
been making you both unhappy for the past two
days."</p>

<p>By this time Marjorie had succeeded in controlling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
her temper, and her voice was quite clear
and steady as she answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, Uncle Henry, but if Elsie
hasn't told you what the trouble is, I am afraid I
can't tell either. Please don't be angry, or think
me disrespectful, but I can't tell; it wouldn't be
fair."</p>

<p>Mr. Carleton was evidently displeased.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, turning away coldly, and
taking up a book, "I have no more to say on the
matter. I am sorry, for I hoped you would have
sufficient confidence in your aunt and me to trust
us, and confide in us. I do not wish to force you
to tell us anything against your will, but you must
remember that your mother has placed you under
our care."</p>

<p>The tears rushed to Marjorie's eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Henry!" she began, then checked
herself abruptly, and, with a half suppressed sob,
turned and fled back to her own room.</p>

<p>It was more than an hour later when Elsie presented
herself at her cousin's door.</p>

<p>"May I come in, Marjorie?" she inquired in
a rather conciliatory tone.</p>

<p>Marjorie looked up from the letter she was
writing; her face brightening with sudden hope.</p>

<p>"Of course you may," she said, heartily.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Elsie, do let us make up; I can't stand not
being friends with people I love."</p>

<p>Elsie advanced slowly into the room and closed
the door.</p>

<p>"Papa has been talking to me," she said, "and
I have promised him to forgive you for what you
said to me the other night. You&mdash;you didn't
tell him anything, did you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Marjorie indignantly, "of course
I didn't. He asked me, but I wouldn't tell. I'm
afraid I made him angry."</p>

<p>Elsie looked much relieved.</p>

<p>"That's all right," she said, speaking more
pleasantly than she had done since the meeting
of the Poetry Club. "We won't say any more
about it. I've torn up that silly poem, and nobody
is going to remember it. If Beverly Randolph
should ever say anything to you, you can
tell him it was just a joke. Now come into my
room, and I'll tell you all about the good time
Carol and I had yesterday."</p>

<p>But although Marjorie accepted the olive
branch, and she and Elsie were apparently as
good friends as ever that evening, her confidence
in her cousin had been cruelly shaken, and she
told herself sadly that she could never feel quite
the same towards Elsie again. Still, it was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
great comfort to be on good terms once more,
and to see the worried expression disappear from
Aunt Julia's face, even though she could not help
feeling a slight shock on hearing her aunt remark
in a low tone to her uncle at the dinner
table:</p>

<p>"Isn't Elsie sweet? I really think she has the
most lovable, forgiving disposition I have ever
known."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>BEVERLY SINGS "MANDALAY"</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a stormy December afternoon, about
ten days later, and Marjorie was alone in her
room preparing her lessons for the next day.
Elsie had gone shopping with her mother, and
Hortense had been sent on an errand. Marjorie
was aroused from the intricacies of a difficult
mathematical problem by a ring at the bell, and
on going to the door, found Beverly Randolph
standing on the threshold.</p>

<p>It was the first time the two had been alone together
since the evening of the Initiation, and in
spite of herself, Marjorie felt her cheeks growing
hot as she asked the visitor to come in. But
Beverly had no intention of referring to unpleasant
bygones.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad to find you at home," he said,
with his pleasant smile and in the voice that always
put people at their ease. "My mother sent
me to ask if you would come and sit with her for
a while this afternoon, provided you have nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
more important to do. She is laid up with a
cold, and is feeling rather blue and forlorn."</p>

<p>"I should love to come," said Marjorie, her
face brightening at the prospect. "I was afraid
your mother might not be well when I didn't see
her at luncheon. I hope she isn't really ill."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; nothing but a disagreeable cold, that
has kept her in the house for the past two days.
I'm glad you can come, for I'm sure it will cheer
her up."</p>

<p>"All right," said Marjorie; "I'll come in just
a minute. I must leave a note for Aunt Julia in
case she should get home before I do."</p>

<p>Marjorie found Mrs. Randolph sitting in an
arm-chair by the fire, looking rather pale and
tired, but her greeting to the girl was just as kind
and cheerful as usual, and Marjorie hoped that
it was only in her imagination that she saw that
sad, wistful expression in her kind friend's eyes.</p>

<p>"Now sit down and tell me about all you have
been doing," said Mrs. Randolph, when the first
greetings had been exchanged. "I love to hear
about the things girls are interested in. My little
Barbara used to tell me of all her good times
as well as her troubles. I am so glad you have
brought your work&mdash;what are you making?"</p>

<p>"A shawl for my aunt's Christmas present;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
one of the girls at school taught me the stitch,
and I think it's going to be very pretty. I shall
have to work hard, though, to finish it in time.
Do you like the color?"</p>

<p>"Very much," said Mrs. Randolph. "I suppose
this will be your first Christmas away from
home?"</p>

<p>A shadow crossed Marjorie's bright face. "I
try not to think of it," she said. "It's going to
be pretty hard, but every one has been so kind,
and Uncle Henry and Aunt Julia are doing so
much for me, that it wouldn't be right to be unhappy.
I think perhaps if I keep very busy I
shall manage to get on all right. Aunt Jessie
says that's a good way of making the best of
things that can't be helped."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph said nothing, but the look she
gave Marjorie was such an understanding one
that the girl's heart warmed towards her more
and more. The next half-hour slipped away
very pleasantly. Mrs. Randolph was one of
those rare people who have the power of drawing
others out, and Marjorie chatted away to her of
school and school-friends, and all the little unimportant
happenings of her New York life, with
almost as much freedom as she would have talked
to her mother or aunt. Then Mrs. Randolph<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
asked her if she liked reading aloud, and when
Marjorie assured her that she had read a great
deal to Aunt Jessie, she explained that, owing to
a cold in her eyes, she had not been able to read
herself for several days. Marjorie was delighted
to be of real use, and they were soon deep in
an interesting story. Marjorie read aloud very
well, and it was an accomplishment of which she
was rather proud.</p>

<p>At five o'clock Beverly, who had gone to his
room to "cram," as he expressed it, returned,
and his mother rang the bell for tea.</p>

<p>"Marjorie and I have had a delightful afternoon,"
she said; "she seems to be almost as fond
of reading aloud as I am of listening. I am going
to be very selfish and ask her to come again
to-morrow, provided she can spare the time.
The doctor doesn't want me to use my eyes much
for several days."</p>

<p>"I shall just love to come," declared Marjorie
eagerly, "and I can easily manage it. My lessons
aren't very hard, and I always have a good
deal of time to myself every day."</p>

<p>"Don't you and your cousin ever go off together
in the afternoons?" Beverly inquired
bluntly.</p>

<p>Marjorie blushed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not very often," she admitted reluctantly.
"You see, Elsie has so many more friends than I
have, and they are always doing things together.
I like the girls at school ever so much, and they
are all very nice and kind to me, but of course
they don't know me very well yet."</p>

<p>"How did the last meeting of the Club come
off?" Beverly asked. "I was sorry I couldn't
go, but I had another engagement."</p>

<p>Marjorie was conscious of a sensation of embarrassment
at this mention of the Club, for she
had not forgotten the secret that she and Beverly
shared together, but she tried to answer quite
naturally.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was very pleasant. The girls have decided
to sew for the little blind children at the
'Home For Blind Babies.' We sewed for three
quarters of an hour, and then Carol said we
might as well stop, and begin to get ready for the
boys. They weren't invited till nine, but some
of the girls seemed to think it would take some
time to get ready for them, though there really
wasn't anything in particular to do. I hope
they'll sew a little longer next time, for if they
don't I'm afraid the Club won't accomplish very
much."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph and Beverly both laughed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
then Beverly sauntered over to the piano, and
began to drum.</p>

<p>"Sing something, dear," said his mother.
"Are you fond of music, Marjorie?"</p>

<p>"I think I should be if I had a chance of hearing
much," said Marjorie, smiling, "but until I
came to New York I had scarcely ever heard any
music except the boys singing on the ranch.
Mother used to play a little when she was a girl,
but we haven't any piano. I love to hear Elsie
play."</p>

<p>"Well, I think you will like to hear Beverly
sing; you know he is on the college Glee Club.
Sing that pretty Irish ballad, 'She Is Far From
the Land,' Beverly; I am sure Marjorie will like
that."</p>

<p>Beverly laughingly protested that he had no
voice whatever, and was sure Marjorie would
want to run away the moment he began to sing,
but good-naturedly yielded to his mother's request,
and after striking a few preliminary
chords, began in a clear tenor voice&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
"'She is far from the land where the young hero lies.'"<br />
</div>

<p>Marjorie&mdash;who had a real love for music&mdash;was
much impressed, and at the close of the ballad,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
begged so earnestly for more, that Beverly
could not help being flattered, and his mother
beamed with pleasure.</p>

<p>Beverly sang several more ballads, and one or
two college songs, and then, after strumming
idly on the piano for a moment, as if uncertain
what to sing next, he suddenly broke into an air
Marjorie knew.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'In the old Mulniam pagoda,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Lookin' eastward to the sea;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There's a Burma gal a-waitin',</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And I know she thinks of me;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For the wind is in the palm-trees,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And the Temple bells they say,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Come you back, you British soldier,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Come you back to Mandalay.</span><br />
<br />
"'Come you back to Mandalay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Where the old flotilla lay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Can't you 'ear their paddles chunkin'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">From Rangoon to Mandalay?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On the road to Mandalay,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Outer China 'cross the bay.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Marjorie turned with a start, arrested by the
sound of a low, half-suppressed sob. Mrs. Randolph
had covered her face with her hands, and
was crying softly. At the same moment Beverly
also turned, and, with an exclamation of dismay,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
hastily sprang to his feet, and hurried to his
mother's side.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother dear, I'm so sorry!" cried the
boy, dropping on his knees, and trying to draw
Mrs. Randolph's hands down from her face. "I
never thought; it was very careless. Oh, Mother
darling, please don't cry&mdash;please forgive me!"</p>

<p>At the sound of her son's voice, Mrs. Randolph
looked up, and tried to smile through her
tears.</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear," she said, gently, "it was
very foolish of me, but that song&mdash;you know
how fond she was of it."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mother, I know; I was a brute to have
forgotten." And Beverly put his strong young
arms tenderly round his mother. Mrs. Randolph
laid her head on his shoulder for a moment,
as if she found comfort in the touch, and
then she roused herself with an effort, dried her
eyes, and turned to Marjorie.</p>

<p>"You must excuse me for being so foolish,
dear," she said, "but that was my little Barbara's
favorite song; she was always asking Beverly
to sing it. I don't think I have heard it since&mdash;since
she went away."</p>

<p>There were tears of sympathy in Marjorie's
eyes, and although she said nothing, the look she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
gave her friend touched Mrs. Randolph, and perhaps
comforted her more than any words would
have done.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 314px;">
<img src="images/i-003.jpg" width="314" height="500" alt="&quot;Oh, Mother Dear, I&#39;m so Sorry!&quot;&mdash;Page 243." title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;<span class='smcap'>Oh, Mother Dear, I&#39;m so Sorry!</span>&quot;&mdash;Page 243.</span>
</div>

<p>Beverly did not sing again, but quietly closed
the piano, and for the rest of the afternoon his
merry boyish face was unusually grave.</p>

<p>"You have given me a great deal of pleasure,"
Mrs. Randolph said, when Marjorie at last rose
to go. "I hope you will come again to-morrow.
It is very tiresome to have to stay in the house
all day, especially when one hasn't the solace of
reading."</p>

<p>Marjorie said she would surely come again,
and then she hurried back to their own apartment,
where she found her aunt and cousin, who
had come in some time before.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton had read Marjorie's note, and
had no objection to the girl's spending as much
time with the invalid as she liked.</p>

<p>"Was Beverly at home?" Elsie inquired, anxiously,
following her cousin to her room.</p>

<p>"He was there some of the time," said Marjorie;
"he had lessons to do at first, but he came
in for tea. Mrs. Randolph asked him to sing&mdash;he
has a beautiful voice."</p>

<p>"You certainly have a way of getting what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
you want," remarked Elsie in a rather dissatisfied
tone; "I wonder how you manage."</p>

<p>"Manage what?" demanded Marjorie in
amazement; "what in the world do you mean,
Elsie?"</p>

<p>Elsie shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess you know," she said, sarcastically,
and walked out of the room, leaving Marjorie
very much puzzled, and more than a little
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph did not recover from her cold
as quickly as she had hoped, and she was confined
to the house for nearly a week. Her eyes, too,
continued troublesome, and reading and sewing
were strictly forbidden. So it came to be quite
a natural thing that Marjorie should spend an
hour every afternoon in the Randolphs' apartment,
and the girl grew to look forward to those
hours as the pleasantest of the whole day.</p>

<p>"You remind me more of my little Barbara
every day," Mrs. Randolph said to her once, and
Marjorie felt that she had received a great compliment.
She was growing to feel a deep interest
in this Barbara, whose tragic death had cast
such a shadow of sorrow over her mother's life,
but she had too much tact, and was too kind-hearted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
to show undue curiosity on a painful
subject, and so, though there were many questions
she would have liked to ask about this unknown
Barbara, she refrained from asking one,
and was fain to content herself with the stray
bits of information that Mrs. Randolph or Beverly
occasionally let fall.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Randolph was well again Marjorie
greatly missed the daily chat, and pleasant hour
of reading aloud. The drives with Aunt Julia,
shut up in the brougham, with only one window
open, proved a most unsatisfactory substitute,
but her aunt was very kind, and showed so much
real interest in the Christmas box she was preparing
for her dear ones at home that Marjorie
reproached herself bitterly for not finding Aunt
Julia's society as agreeable as Mrs. Randolph's.
But Christmas was drawing near, and there were
times when Marjorie fought desperately against
the homesickness, which seemed almost greater
than she could bear.</p>

<p>To add to everything else, she caught a feverish
cold, and Mrs. Carleton, who was always
nervous about illness, insisted on her remaining
in the house; a state of affairs hitherto unknown
to healthy Marjorie, who had never in her life
spent a day in bed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>It was on the second afternoon of headache
and sore throat that Mrs. Randolph came to the
rescue. Marjorie had come to the end of her
resources. She had read till her eyes ached, and
sewed on Christmas presents until she felt that
she couldn't take another stitch. The longing for
fresh air and exercise was almost beyond her endurance,
and yet she dared not even open a window,
for fear of incurring her aunt's displeasure.
Mrs. Carleton and Elsie were out, but Hortense
had been left in charge, with strict injunctions
to see that Mademoiselle Marjorie kept out of
draughts, and took her medicine regularly. Marjorie
was just wondering in her desperation
whether a walk up and down the steam-heated
hotel corridor would be regarded in the light of
an imprudence, when there was a ring at the bell,
and Hortense announced Mrs. Randolph.</p>

<p>"I have only just heard you were ill," the visitor
said kindly, taking Marjorie's hand in hers,
and looking with sympathetic interest into the
pale, woe-begone face. "Your aunt told Beverly
at luncheon that you had a bad cold. You
should have let me know sooner; I can't have
my kind little friend laid up without trying to return
some of her goodness to me."</p>

<p>"It wasn't goodness at all," said Marjorie,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
flushing with pleasure; "it was just having a
lovely time. I was thinking only yesterday, what
a very selfish girl I must be, for I couldn't help
being sorry you didn't need me any more, it's so
pleasant to be needed."</p>

<p>Marjorie's voice trembled a little, for she was
feeling rather weak and forlorn, and Mrs. Randolph
drew her down beside her on the sofa.</p>

<p>"I think I always need you, dear," she said.
"I have missed your visits very much, and reading
to myself doesn't seem half as pleasant as
having a nice little girl read aloud to me. Still,
I am glad to have the use of my eyes again, especially
as we are going away next week."</p>

<p>"Going away!" repeated Marjorie, and her
face expressed so much dismay that Mrs. Randolph
could not help smiling.</p>

<p>"We are not going for good," she explained,
"but Beverly's vacation begins next Wednesday,
and he is anxious to spend Christmas at our Virginia
home. We shall only be away about ten
days."</p>

<p>Marjorie looked much relieved.</p>

<p>"I was afraid you meant you were going to
Europe, or somewhere far away," she said, "and
that I shouldn't see you any more. I don't know
what I should do without you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I should miss you very much, too," said
Mrs. Randolph, "but nothing so unpleasant is
going to happen, I hope. What are your plans
for the holidays?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing in particular. Elsie and I are
invited to several parties, and Aunt Julia's sister,
Mrs. Ward, is having a tree on Christmas night.
I can't help wishing the holidays were over. It
will be my first Christmas away from home, you
know."</p>

<p>"I suppose your family will miss you as much
as you miss them," Mrs. Randolph said, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know they will, and that is one of the
hardest things to bear. I had a letter from Undine
to-day, and she says they are all very sad,
though they are trying hard to be brave and
cheerful."</p>

<p>"Who is Undine?"</p>

<p>"Oh, haven't I told you about her? She's a
girl who lives at the ranch, and we call her Undine,
but it isn't her real name."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph looked interested.</p>

<p>"What is her real name?" she asked, anxious
to cheer Marjorie by talking of home and friends.</p>

<p>Marjorie opened her lips to explain, but suddenly
remembered something Beverly had told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
her. It would be scarcely possible to tell Undine's
story without mentioning the fatal subject
of the earthquake, so she only said:</p>

<p>"We don't know her real name, but the people
she lived with before she came to the ranch
called her Sally. She didn't like Sally, and asked
us to call her something else, and I suggested
Undine."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph laughed. "A rather romantic
name for a flesh and blood girl," she said; "how
old is your Undine?"</p>

<p>"About fifteen, we think, but we are not sure,
and she doesn't know herself. Lulu Bell says
you have a beautiful home in Virginia. I suppose
you will be glad to go there for the holidays."</p>

<p>"Yes, we all love it very much. It is a dear
old place; my husband's family have lived there
for generations, and my old home, where I lived
before I married, is only a couple of miles
away."</p>

<p>"I have always thought Virginia must be a
very interesting place," said Marjorie. "I have
read ever so many books about the early settlers
in Jamestown. Have you read 'To Have and to
Hold,' and 'White Aprons'?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have read both. Our home is on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
James River, not far from Jamestown&mdash;would
you like to see it?"</p>

<p>"I should love it," said Marjorie, heartily.
"I don't suppose I ever shall though," she added,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>"I don't see why not," said Mrs. Randolph,
smiling. "How would you like to go home with
us for the holidays?"</p>

<p>Marjorie was speechless. For the first moment
she could scarcely believe that her friend
was in earnest.</p>

<p>"I came this afternoon on purpose to propose
it," Mrs. Randolph went on, convinced by the
girl's flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes that
there was no doubt about her wanting to accept
the invitation. "Beverly and I were speaking
of it last evening. We shall be alone except for
Dr. Randolph, who is going with us, but we have
some pleasant young people in the neighborhood,
and there is generally a good deal going on at
Christmas. I think you would have a pleasant
time."</p>

<p>"It would be the next best thing to going
home," declared Marjorie, "but, oh, dear Mrs.
Randolph, are you sure you really want
me?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure," said Mrs. Randolph, kissing her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
"It will make us all very happy to have our nice
little friend with us."</p>

<p>"If only Aunt Julia will let me go," said Marjorie,
with a vivid recollection of her aunt's rebuke
on the evening after the football game.</p>

<p>But, contrary to Marjorie's expectations, Mrs.
Carleton made no objection to the plan, beyond
hoping that the Randolphs would not find her
niece too much care. Neither did Elsie make
any of the unpleasant remarks her cousin expected.
Since the first meeting of the Poetry
Club, Beverly and she had not had much to say
to each other. Beverly was always polite, but
Elsie could never feel quite comfortable in his
society, and the knowledge that he was not to
share in any of the holiday gayeties was something
of a relief. She and Marjorie were apparently
very good friends, but there was a look
in Marjorie's eyes sometimes when they rested
on her cousin, which Elsie did not like. So when
Mrs. Carleton consulted her daughter on the subject
of Marjorie's going to Virginia with the
Randolph's, Elsie said good-naturedly:</p>

<p>"Oh, let her go, Mamma; she'll have a much
better time than she would here. It would be
such a bother to have to take her everywhere,
and see she had partners at the dances, and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
that. Papa would be sure to ask questions and
make a fuss if she didn't have a good time."</p>

<p>So the invitation was accepted, and Marjorie
wrote a long, joyful letter to her mother, and
went to bed that night, feeling happier than she
had done since coming to New York.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>IN THE SUNNY SOUTH</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">It's</span> the most beautiful place I've ever even
imagined!" Marjorie spoke with conviction, and
drew in a long, deep breath of the fresh morning
air.</p>

<p>She and Beverly were standing on the wide
veranda at Randolph Place gazing off over the
wide landscape, of low Virginia hills, with the
wide river less than half a mile away. It was a
glorious morning, and the peace and quiet seemed
indescribably delightful after the noisy, stuffy
night on the train. Beverly was very proud of
his Southern home, but boy like, he tried not to
show it.</p>

<p>"It's pretty enough," he admitted, "but this
isn't the season to see it at its best; you ought to
come here in the spring."</p>

<p>"It's perfect just as it is," declared Marjorie.
"I've read about such places, but never expected
to see one myself. Is that river really the James,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and did your great-grandfather truly live in this
very house?"</p>

<p>"He most certainly did," said Beverly, laughing;
"my people have lived here for over a hundred
years. You should have heard some of my
father's war stories. He was only a boy at the
time of the war, but he had some exciting experiences.
When I was a little chap I used to wish I
had been alive then, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, I love war stories!" cried Marjorie,
rapturously; "are there any people here now who
can tell them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, plenty. I'll introduce you to
old Uncle Josh. He was my grandfather's body
servant, and went all through the war with him.
He's over seventy now, and doesn't work any
more, but he and his wife live in a cabin down at
the quarters."</p>

<p>"It all sounds just like a story-book," said
Marjorie, with a little sigh of utter content. "I
should think you would be tremendously proud
of your home."</p>

<p>"I like it all right," said Beverly, "but now
hadn't you better come in and have some breakfast?
I hear Mother and Uncle George in the
dining-room, and I should think you'd be hungry,
for it's after nine, and you were up before six."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course I was," laughed Marjorie; "I was
much too excited to sleep. I wasn't going to
miss the first sight of Virginia."</p>

<p>The dining-room at Randolph Place was very
large, and the walls were lined with portraits.
Marjorie was so much interested in the portraits
of great-grandfather and great-grandmother
Randolph, that she came near forgetting to eat
her breakfast, although the fried eggs and bacon,
and waffles with maple syrup, were certainly the
most delicious she had ever tasted. Mrs. Randolph
and the doctor watched her with kindly
amusement. Her eyes were sparkling with excitement,
and there was a bright color in her
cheeks; she seemed quite a different creature
from the pale, subdued girl of a week before.</p>

<p>"I declare, Barbara, I had no idea that little
girl was so pretty," Dr. Randolph remarked in a
low tone to his sister-in-law, when Marjorie and
Beverly were in the midst of an animated discussion
about Captain John Smith and Pocahontas.</p>

<p>"She is charming," Mrs. Randolph answered,
smiling. "It is strange how much environment
has to do with appearance."</p>

<p>"And now I am going to take you to your
room, Marjorie," said Mrs. Randolph as they
rose from the breakfast table. "You will want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
to unpack and wash up a little after that dusty
journey. I have asked some cousins of ours, the
Pattersons, to luncheon, and perhaps this afternoon
you and Beverly will like to go for a ride.
I needn't ask if you are accustomed to riding;
every girl brought up on a ranch must be."</p>

<p>"I have ridden ever since I can remember,"
said Marjorie, her eyes sparkling at the prospect
of the coming pleasure. "I would rather ride a
horse than do anything else in the world."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph laughed, and led the way up a
broad oak staircase, and along a wide hall, to the
prettiest little room imaginable, all furnished in
pink and white; a typical girl's room, as Marjorie
saw at the first glance.</p>

<p>"I have put you here because this room is next
to mine," Mrs. Randolph explained. "I thought
you would like it better than being away down at
the other end of the hall. This was my little
Barbara's room," she added softly; "no one has
slept here since she left it, and nothing has been
changed."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Randolph," cried Marjorie, gratefully,
"how very good you are to me, but are you
sure you really want me to have this room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I am quite sure I do. If my Barbara
were alive I know she would love you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and I like to think I shall have a little girl next
to me again to-night."</p>

<p>With a sudden impulse, Marjorie flung her
arms round Mrs. Randolph's neck and hugged
her. She did not speak&mdash;words did not come
easily just then&mdash;but Barbara's mother understood,
and the kiss she gave in return was a very
tender one.</p>

<p>When Marjorie was left alone, her first occupation
was to look about the room, and examine
all its details. It was very simple, but everything
was in perfect taste, and the girl admired it
all, from the pretty china ornaments on the bureau,
to the row of books on a shelf over the writing-desk.
She took down one of the books reverently;
it seemed almost like sacrilege to touch
these things that had belonged to another girl,
whose death had been so very sad. It was
"Lorna Doone," and on the fly-leaf Marjorie
read, "To Barbara Randolph, from her affectionate
cousin, Grace Patterson." Then she examined
the framed photographs on the mantelpiece;
Mrs. Randolph and Beverly, and a gentleman
whom she supposed must have been Barbara's
father. There were other photographs as
well, one in particular of a girl with curly hair,
and a very friendly expression, and Marjorie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
wondered if she could be the cousin, who had
given Barbara "Lorna Doone." It was strange
how intimate she was beginning to feel with this
Barbara, who had died nearly three years ago.</p>

<p>Marjorie had just finished her unpacking when
there was a tap at her door, and in answer to her
"Come in," a girl of about her own age presented
herself. One glance was sufficient to assure
Marjorie that she was the same curly-haired,
friendly-faced girl, whose photograph, in a silver
frame, stood in a prominent place on the writing-desk.</p>

<p>"I'm Grace Patterson," announced the visitor,
in a voice as friendly as her face. "Cousin Barbara
told me to come right up; my brother and
I have come over especially to see you."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to meet you," said Marjorie,
shaking hands, and drawing forward a chair for
her guest. "I've just been looking at your picture,"
she added, smiling.</p>

<p>Grace Patterson glanced about the room, and a
shade of sadness crossed her bright face.</p>

<p>"It seems so strange to be in this room again,"
she said; "I haven't been here since poor Babs&mdash;you've
heard about Babs, of course?"</p>

<p>Marjorie nodded.</p>

<p>"She was my chum," said Grace, with a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
catch in her voice, "and one of the dearest girls
that ever lived. We were almost the same age,
and as neither of us had any sisters, we were together
a great deal. Babs had a governess, and
my younger brother and I used to come over here
every day for lessons. Our place is only two
miles away, and my mother and Cousin Barbara
are great friends. It nearly killed poor Cousin
Barbara."</p>

<p>"I know," said Marjorie. "It was lovely of
Mrs. Randolph to let me have this room. I have
been so interested in Barbara ever since I first
heard about her, but I don't like to talk to her
mother or brother about her."</p>

<p>"You know how it happened, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; Beverly told me that. It must have
been a frightful shock to you all."</p>

<p>"Frightful! I should say it was. Even Beverly
has never been quite the same since. He
was devoted to Babs, and they were such chums.
I don't think it would have been quite so terrible
if they could have recognized her afterward, but
she was so frightfully injured&mdash;oh, I can't bear
to talk about it! They recognized Miss Randolph,
Bab's aunt, but poor Babs was completely
crushed, and&mdash;oh, let's come downstairs. I
can't stand it up here; it gives me the horrors."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>There were more questions Marjorie would
have liked to ask, but the subject was evidently
a very painful one to her new acquaintance, for
Grace had grown rather pale, and there was a
look of horror in her eyes. So she said no more,
and the two girls went downstairs, where they
found the family assembled, and where Marjorie
was introduced to Harry Patterson&mdash;Grace's
brother&mdash;a pleasant-faced boy of seventeen.</p>

<p>The Pattersons stayed to luncheon, and Marjorie
liked them immensely. Grace soon recovered
from the momentary depression, caused by
recalling painful memories, and Marjorie was
quite ready to endorse Beverly's opinion that
"she was one of the jolliest girls going." They
had a very merry morning, and after luncheon it
was proposed that Marjorie and Beverly should
ride home with the Pattersons, who had come
over on their ponies.</p>

<p>"Marjorie is pining for a gallop, I know,"
said Beverly, laughing; "she is as wild about
horses as you are, Grace, and trained a colt when
she was nine."</p>

<p>"How jolly!" cried Grace; "you and I can
have some fine rides together, Marjorie. I
haven't had a girl to ride with since&mdash;" Grace
did not finish her sentence, but Marjorie knew by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
her suddenly heightened color, and the glance
she gave Beverly, that she was thinking of her
cousin Barbara.</p>

<p>"I declare they've brought Nelly Gray for you
to ride!" whispered Grace to Marjorie, as the
two girls stood on the veranda, waiting to mount.
"I didn't know any one rode her now."</p>

<p>"She's a beauty," said Marjorie, with an admiring
glance at the handsome little chestnut
mare, which was being led up to the door by a
groom.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's a love! She was Babs's pony, and
Babs loved her dearly. I remember she taught
her to take sugar out of her pocket."</p>

<p>Nelly Gray certainly was "a love" and Marjorie
enjoyed that ride as she had enjoyed few
things since leaving her Western home. It was
a beautiful afternoon, and Nelly herself appeared
to enjoy it almost as much as her rider. They
took the longest way round to the Patterson
home, and when they had left their friends, Beverly
proposed that they should ride a few miles
farther, and come home by a different road.</p>

<p>"I think I could ride all night without getting
tired," laughed Marjorie. "This is an adorable
pony."</p>

<p>"She was my sister's pony," said Beverly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I know, your cousin told me. It was
awfully good of you and your mother to let me
ride her."</p>

<p>Beverly said nothing, and they rode on for a
few moments in silence, both young faces unusually
grave. Marjorie was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"I wish I could make your mother understand
how much I appreciate all she has done for me,"
she said, impulsively. "Do you know she has
given me your sister's room?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she told me she was going to. Mother
is very fond of you, and she says she thinks Babs
would have loved you, too."</p>

<p>"I know I should have loved her," said Marjorie,
earnestly. "Grace has been telling me
about her, and I have been looking at all her
things."</p>

<p>"She was almost as fond of riding as you are,"
said Beverly. "She was such a plucky little
girl; never afraid of anything. She rode better
than any girl in the neighborhood."</p>

<p>Beverly's voice sounded a little husky, and
Marjorie thought it might be best to change the
subject, so she launched into an account of a
"round up" she had once seen, and the rest of
the ride was a very merry one.</p>

<p>"Will you mind if I stop for a moment to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
speak to my old mammy?" Beverly asked, as they
were on their way home. "She lives in one of
these cabins, and I know she'll be on the lookout
for me."</p>

<p>"Of course I won't mind," said Marjorie,
promptly; "I shall love it. I've never seen a
real colored mammy, but I've often read about
them in stories."</p>

<p>"Well, you shall see one now. Ours was the
genuine article, though people pretend to say the
old-fashioned darky is a thing of the past. She
was devoted to Babs and me, although she was a
firm believer in the efficacy of the rod. We
loved her dearly, and minded her better than we
minded Mother. She was put on the pension
list several years ago, and now has a cabin to
herself. Here it is, and there's Mammy on the
watch for us, as I was sure she would be. Hello,
Mammy, here's your bad boy back again!"</p>

<p>Beverly sprang to the ground, and the next
moment was being rapturously hugged by a very
stout old negress, with a turban on her head.
She was so exactly Marjorie's idea of what a
mammy ought to be, that the girl was delighted,
and sat looking on with deep interest, while Beverly
and his old nurse exchanged greetings.
Then Marjorie herself was introduced, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Mammy begged them both to tie their horses,
and come in for a cup of tea. But Beverly declared
it was too late, and they finally made
their escape, having promised to come another
day, for a feast of the waffles, for which it appeared
Mammy was famous.</p>

<p>"It has been one of the loveliest days I've
ever had," Marjorie declared, as they rode up the
avenue at Randolph Place, in the light of the setting
sun. "I shall never forget it as long as I
live, and I shall have so much to write home in
my next letter, that I believe it will fill a volume."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>A VIRGINIA CHRISTMAS</h3>


<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'>

<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"Randolph Place,</span><br />
"December 26th.<br />
</div>

"<span class="smcap">Darling Aunt Jessie</span>:

<p>"Christmas is over, and it really wasn't half
as bad as I thought it was going to be. But before
I begin writing about anything else, I must
tell you how happy I was to get all your dear
home letters. Uncle Henry was so kind about
forwarding them as soon as they reached New
York, and I had them all on Christmas Eve.
Aunt Julia wrote me the box has come, too, but
she will have to keep that until I get back the end
of next week. How I shall adore every single
thing in it!</p>

<p>"I sent mother a few lines the morning I got
here, but that was before I had found out how
beautiful it all is. It is just like the Southern
plantations one reads about in stories, and everything
is very interesting. There is even a dear
old black mammy, who lives in a cabin, and has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
asked Beverly and me to come and have waffles
some afternoon. All the servants are black, and
the butler has lived in the family nearly forty
years. Then the neighbors are just the kind one
reads of, so kind and hospitable, and always having
good times. I think I like Southerners better
than New Yorkers; they make me feel much
more at home. I have met a good many of
them, for we went to a Christmas dance at the
Pattersons', on Christmas Eve, and I had a perfectly
gorgeous time. The Pattersons are cousins
of the Randolphs', and Grace, the girl, is
just my age, and awfully nice; but then everybody
here is nice, and I am having the very best
time that it is possible for a girl to have.</p>

<p>"The riding is the greatest pleasure of all.
Beverly and I have been out for a ride every
day, and he enjoys it almost as much as I do.
They have given me the dearest little chestnut to
ride, and it is a great honor, because she belonged
to Beverly's sister, who was killed in the
San Francisco earthquake, and scarcely any one
has ridden her since. She is very gentle, and so
friendly that she will take sugar out of my
pocket. Beverly says his sister taught her to do
that.</p>

<p>"But if I go on chattering like this, I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
never get to Christmas, which was the most interesting
of all. The Virginians seem to think a
great deal of Christmas, and nearly all the day
before we were busy dressing a tree for the little
negroes on the plantation. Mrs. Randolph had
brought presents from New York for all of them,
and for the fathers and mothers as well. Beverly
says she has done the same thing every
Christmas since her little girl died; it is a sort of
memorial, I suppose. We all hung up our stockings,
even Mrs. Randolph and the doctor, who is
just as nice and jolly as he can be, though Grace
Patterson says some people are afraid of him.
It was late when we got back from the Pattersons'
party on Christmas Eve, but after I was in
bed I heard Mrs. Randolph going about softly,
filling the stockings, which were all hung outside
our doors.</p>

<p>"I was so tired after the party, that I didn't
wake till after seven, and then the very first thing
I did was to run and look at my stocking. It
was stuffed full of good things; oranges, candy,
figs and dates, and just as I thought I had
reached the bottom, I felt something hard away
down in the toe. What do you think it was?
You will never guess, so I may as well tell you
right away; it was a little velvet box, and inside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
was a ring, a beautiful gold ring, with two adorable
little pearls in it! That was Mrs. Randolph's
Christmas present, and the loveliest thing
I have ever had in my life. I was so happy when
I saw it that I cried; I know it was dreadfully
silly, but I couldn't help it. Oh, how I wish I
could show it to you this minute, but you will see
it when I come home next June, and all my other
presents, too, for the ring wasn't the only one.
When I came down to breakfast there were more
parcels beside my plate; two nice books from
Beverly, and a gold bracelet from the doctor.
Just think of it, two pieces of jewelry in one day!
I am sure I didn't deserve such beautiful things,
but when I told them so, and tried to thank them,
they only laughed.</p>

<p>"In the morning we went to church, and the
Christmas music was lovely. We met the Pattersons
at church, and they all came home with
us to dinner. Oh, such a dinner! I don't see
how any one could possibly ever eat so many
things. There were more dishes than I have
ever imagined possible for one meal, and every
single one was delicious.</p>

<p>"After dinner came the tree for the children,
and that was the best fun of all. I quite lost my
heart to some of the piccaninnies, and one little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
chap, as black as coal, was so adorable that I
wanted to hug him. The children all had a
beautiful time, and screamed with delight over
their presents. How I wished you and Mother
could have seen Mrs. Randolph going about
among them, speaking so pleasantly to every one,
and making them all feel at home. After the
tree had been stripped they all had ice cream, and
I got hold of my little black boy, and made him
sit on my lap while I fed him until I don't believe
he could have swallowed another mouthful.
Then the old butler, who is just like a negro servant
in a book, proposed three cheers for Mrs.
Randolph, and you should have heard those
darkies yell!</p>

<p>"The Pattersons left as soon as the fun was
over, and we all went upstairs to our rooms to
rest. But I wasn't a bit tired, and was afraid
that if I sat down to think I might be homesick,
so I thought I would go for a walk. I was just
starting when I saw Mrs. Randolph come out
from the greenhouse, with her hat on, and her
hands full of beautiful roses, and I stopped to ask
if she were going for a walk, too, and if I might
go with her. She hesitated for a minute, and
then said I might come if I liked, but she was
afraid I would find it sad; she was going to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
cemetery to put flowers on her little girl's grave.
She said it quite calmly, but there was such a sad
look in her eyes, and I was horribly embarrassed,
for I was afraid I ought not to have suggested
going with her. But she assured me she would
really like to have me, if I didn't mind, so of
course I went, and, oh, Aunt Jessie, I am so glad
I did. It was all beautiful and sacred&mdash;almost
too sacred to write about, even to you and
Mother. The cemetery was such a lovely, peaceful
place, and as it was quite warm and pleasant,
we sat down by Barbara Randolph's grave, and
her mother talked to me about her. It was the
first time she has ever told me much about Barbara,
and I was so interested in all she said. I
don't think I shall ever be afraid of dying again;
Mrs. Randolph spoke so beautifully about it.
She says she can never feel that her little girl
is far away, and she is quite sure they will be together
again some day. I think Barbara must
have been an awfully nice girl; every one seems
so fond of her. Grace Patterson was her chum,
and she can hardly speak of her without crying.
As for Beverly, he just can't bear to talk about
her at all, and I don't dare ask him a single question.
Grace says he was devoted to her, and she
adored him. I wish I could see a picture of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Barbara, but there are no photographs of her
about. Mrs. Randolph wears a little gold locket,
and I am sure there is a miniature of Barbara inside,
but I have never had the courage to ask
her to show it to me. I was just making up
my mind to do it yesterday, when we heard
footsteps, and there was Beverly himself, bringing
more flowers. He didn't know we were
there, and looked horribly embarrassed when he
saw us. Boys always hate to show their feelings,
and I think he would have gone away again
without speaking to us, if his mother hadn't
called him. She was so pleased to see him, and
after the first minute I don't think he really
minded. I thought they might like to be alone,
so I slipped away as quietly as I could, and on
the way home I met the doctor, and he asked
me to go for a walk with him. I know you
would like Dr. Randolph; he is so clever, and has
traveled almost all over the world. He told
me such an interesting story about a Christmas
he once spent in Jerusalem. It is so pleasant
that he met Father at Harvard, and remembers
all about him. He says Father was a very handsome
boy, and a great favorite with the girls.
Doesn't it seem queer to think of Father's going
to dances and flirting with girls! He looks so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
much older than Dr. Randolph, and yet I suppose
they must be about the same age.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Randolph and Beverly were quite cheerful
when they came home, and I noticed that
Beverly was very gentle with his mother all the
evening. He is always nice to her, and that is
one of the reasons why I like him so much.
One of the things that has surprised me most
of all in New York, is the way some of the girls
and boys speak to their fathers and mothers. I
really don't know what Mother would do to me
if I were ever to answer her back the way Elsie
sometimes answers Aunt Julia, but her mother
doesn't seem to mind.</p>

<p>"We had a quiet evening at home, but it was
pleasant, for we were all a little tired. Mrs.
Randolph and the doctor played cribbage, and
Beverly sang; he has a lovely voice, but he won't
often sing. Altogether my Christmas was a very
happy one, and if I did 'weep a little weep' after
I was in bed, it was only natural, considering
it was my first Christmas away from you all.
Oh, Aunt Jessie, darling, I am having a beautiful
visit, but I never forget you, or Father or
Mother, a single minute! I love your letters
better than anything else, and I am just longing
to get my hands on that precious Christmas box.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
I hope you will all like the presents I sent.
Uncle Henry was so kind; he gave me twenty-five
dollars to spend for Christmas presents. I
never had so much money in my life, but Aunt
Julia helped me select the presents, which was a
great relief, for I should never have known what
to buy without her. Things seem to cost so much
more than one expects them to.</p>

<p>"I felt sure you and Mother would want
something I had made myself, and I hope you
will like the color of the shawl; Mrs. Randolph
thought it very pretty. I chose the little daisy
pin for Undine, because I liked it so much myself.
I am so glad you have all grown so fond
of her, and that she is happy, and doesn't worry
so much about not remembering.</p>

<p>"Beverly is calling me to go for a ride, so
I must stop writing. Heaps of hugs and kisses
for everybody from</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>MARJORIE SEES A PHOTOGRAPH</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Don't</span> you think there is always something
very sad about last days in places?"</p>

<p>Beverly laughed, and cast an amused glance
at his companion's sober face. He and Marjorie
were trotting leisurely along a road where the
trees met overhead in summer, although now the
boughs were leafless, and there was a light covering
of snow on the ground. It was their last
afternoon in Virginia, and they were making the
most of it, despite a lowering sky, and a frostiness
in the air, which threatened more snow before
night.</p>

<p>"Just think," Marjorie went on mournfully,
"I sha'n't have another ride for five whole
months. School doesn't close till the first of
June."</p>

<p>"Why don't you ride in the park? Lots of
girls do, you know. Ask your uncle to hire a
horse for you from the riding academy."</p>

<p>Marjorie blushed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't like to," she said, frankly. "Uncle
Henry and Aunt Julia are doing so much for me
already, I don't think I ought to ask for anything
more. Elsie doesn't ride in New York."</p>

<p>"Well, I have no doubt she could if she wanted
to. I imagine Miss Elsie generally gets what
she wants."</p>

<p>"You don't like Elsie, do you?" The words
were out before Marjorie realized she had uttered
them. The next moment she wished she
had not asked the question.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said Beverly, honestly.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry; I wish you did; she's so clever,
and&mdash;and there are lots of nice things about
her. You see, she is an only child, and her father
and mother worship her. I suppose she
can't help being a little spoiled."</p>

<p>"Well, you are an only child, too, and I have
no doubt your family are as fond of you as
Elsie's are of her, but you are not spoiled."</p>

<p>Marjorie was silent. She felt that loyalty to
her cousin required her to say something in Elsie's
defence, and yet what could she say? After a
moment's silence Beverly went on.</p>

<p>"I should like your cousin a lot better if she
resigned from being president of that Club."</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she tore up the poem," faltered Marjorie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
"She said it was trash. I don't think
she meant to do anything mean, but she is so
clever, she couldn't bear to have any other poem
better than hers."</p>

<p>"You're a loyal little soul, Marjorie," said
Beverly, approvingly, "but all you can say won't
alter the fact that your cousin did a mean, contemptible
thing. She knows I found her out,
and she hasn't looked me straight in the face
since. I don't like sneaks in girls any better than
in boys."</p>

<p>Marjorie felt the conversation had gone far
enough. She did not wish to discuss Elsie even
with Beverly Randolph, although the two had
become great friends during the past ten days,
so after a little pause, she changed the subject
by asking her companion if he did not think they
had better be turning towards home.</p>

<p>Beverly glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"I suppose we'd better," he said, reluctantly.
"I hate to cut our last ride short, but Mammy
will be heart-broken if we keep her waffles waiting."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad we are going to Mammy's cabin,"
Marjorie said, as they turned the horses' heads
in a homeward direction. "It makes me think
of so many things I have read. Don't you remember<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
in 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' how George
Selby used to slip away from the big house, and
go down to Uncle Tom's for waffles and fried
chicken? Mammy is such an old dear; I do
want to hear her talk again."</p>

<p>"She certainly is a character," said Beverly,
laughing. "We'll get her to tell some anecdotes
about Barbara and me. According to Mammy
I must have been a pickle."</p>

<p>Marjorie was conscious of a feeling of relief
at having successfully turned the conversation
away from Elsie and her affairs, and she and
Beverly chatted on pleasantly until they reached
Mammy's cabin, where they dismounted and
Beverly tied the horses to the hitching post.
Mammy was on the watch for them, and gave
them a hearty welcome.</p>

<p>"Now you jes lay off yo' tings, and set down
by de fiah," she commanded, placing chairs for
the visitors, "an' I'll have dem waffles done in
a jiffy. Lor', Mas'r Bev'ly, it jes' does my heart
good to see you settin' heah in my kitchen, like
you used to do when you an' Miss Babs&mdash;now
Mas'r Bev'ly, don't you tease my Josephus; he
mighty 'telligent cat, he is. He won't stan' no
foolin'."</p>

<p>"He's a beauty," said Marjorie, stooping to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
stroke the big maltese, who responded to the
caress by springing on the arm of her chair.</p>

<p>Mammy beamed with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Josephus likes you fust rate, Missy," she said,
approvingly. "He don't make friends with mos'
folks; he's too 'ristocratic. He knows what's
what, Josephus does."</p>

<p>"Mammy is the most delicious snob," laughed
Beverly; "she only allows Josephus to associate
with aristocratic cats. All the unfortunate
plebeian cats in the neighborhood are driven
away with a stick."</p>

<p>"Cose dey is," declared Mammy, indignantly.
"What yo s'pose I want common, no-'count cats
botherin' round heah for? Ain't I always lived
in de most 'ristocratic Virginia fam'lies, and
wasn't my paw own body-servant to ole General
Putnam, an' my maw bought by Mas'r Randolph's
father when she weren't more'n ten years
old, an' brought up in de house, to be maid to de
young ladies? I'se lived in de fust fam'lies, I
has, and I'm proud of it, too."</p>

<p>"What a perfectly heavenly place!" whispered
Marjorie to Beverly, with a glance round
the neat little kitchen, as the old negress bustled
away intent on household duties.</p>

<p>"You must get Mammy to show you the family<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
photographs before we go," said Beverly; "she
has quite a gallery, and can give you the separate
history of each picture. Ah, here come the
waffles. Nobody can beat you on waffles,
Mammy."</p>

<p>The old woman grinned.</p>

<p>"Cose dey cyan't," she said, placidly. "Dere
cyan't nobody in dese parts beat me on waffles
and corn-bread. Folks comes askin' for my
recipes, but it ain't de recipe dat does it, it's de
light hand. Now Mas'r Bev'ly, don't you take
de whole dishful; dere's plenty more comin'.
Lor' sakes, Missy, you jes' oughter seen de way
dat boy would go in for waffles an' maple syrup
when he was little. Do you 'member de day,
Mas'r Bev'ly, when yo maw was havin' lot of
comp'ny for tea, an' yo' an' Miss Babs sneaked
into de pantry, and eat up all de lobster salad
'fo' de comp'ny got a chance to have it? What
a swattin' I did give de two of you' for dat!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed I remember it," said Beverly,
laughing. "I deserved the 'swatting' more
than Babs did, for she was only four and I was
eight."</p>

<p>"Dat's true; but yo' bofe deserved it bad
enough. Lordie! How dat chile Babs could
stuff! Notin' ever hurted her, and de wust of it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
was, she didn't mind castor oil no more'n if it
was molasses. Have some more syrup, Missy;
waffles ain't no good without plenty of syrup.
You was forever gettin' Miss Babs into mischief,
Mas'r Bev'ly. I'll never forget de day I dressed
de two of you in yo' best white suits, cause yo'
grandmother Randolph was comin' on a visit,
an' de minute my back was turned you was bofe
off to de swamp. My, what sights you was when
I found you! Miss Babs had tumbled in, an'
yo' two faces was as black as mine, and you was
all over black mud. You bofe got a good whippin',
an' was put to bed in de middle of de day,
but Lordie! What good did it do? Miss Babs
was sound asleep in ten minutes, and never woke
up till nex' mornin'. Nottin' ever upset her fo'
long; God bless her."</p>

<p>The old woman's voice grew very gentle and
Beverly, who had been smiling over the childish
reminiscences, grew suddenly grave. But Mammy
was a cheerful soul, and she did not intend
to sadden the young people's visit.</p>

<p>"Well, de Lord has his reasons, I s'pose," she
said, with a sigh, "but dey does seem hard to
make out sometimes. Jes' 'scuse me one minute;
I got some hot ones on de fiah."</p>

<p>When Marjorie and Beverly had eaten so many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
waffles that they felt as though they should not
require anything more in the way of food for
days, Mammy reluctantly desisted from her
hospitable efforts to force another plateful upon
her visitors, and the hospitably entertained young
people rose to go.</p>

<p>"I've had a lovely time," declared Marjorie,
heartily. "It was dear of you to let me come,
Mammy; I shall never forget it."</p>

<p>"Any frien' of de Randolph fam'ly is always
welcome to my cabin," said Mammy, with the
air of a queen dispensing hospitality to her subjects.
"Would you like to see de fam'ly pictures
'fo' you go?"</p>

<p>Marjorie said she would like nothing better,
and while Beverly went out to untie the horses,
she followed Mammy into her tiny bedroom,
the walls of which were literally covered with
photographs.</p>

<p>"Dis," announced Mammy, pausing in the
doorway, and pointing to a gentleman in uniform,
"is Mas'r Will Randolph, Mas'r Bev'ly's
gran'father, took in de clothes he wore when he
went to de wah. Dis lady is his wife, de mis'
Randolph dat brought up my maw; a gran' lady
she was too. Dis is Mas'r Bev'ly's father when
he went away to school, jes after de wah was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
over. Dis one is Mas'r Bev'ly's maw in her
first ball dress. Dat's Mas'r Bev'ly when he was
a baby, and here's Miss Babs in her fust short
clothes. Over on dis side is Mas'r Bev'ly when
he was seven, and dis is&mdash;oh, good Lordie,
Missy, whatever is de matter?"</p>

<p>Marjorie&mdash;who had been following Mammy
from one photograph to another, with amused
interest&mdash;had suddenly uttered a sharp cry of
astonishment, and was staring blankly at the photograph
of a girl of twelve, which was occupying
the place of honor over Mammy's bed.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;who is that?" she gasped, seizing
the old woman's arm, and beginning to tremble
with excitement.</p>

<p>"Dat Miss Babs, took jes' 'fo' she went away
to Californy," said Mammy, sadly. "Land
sakes, Missy! What is it? You jes' sit right
down heah, an' I'll go call Mas'r Bev'ly."</p>

<p>When Beverly appeared in answer to Mammy's
hasty summons, he found Marjorie ghastly
white, and shaking from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, Marjorie!" exclaimed the
boy, springing to her side, "what's the matter?
Don't you feel well&mdash;is it the waffles?"</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's Undine!" faltered Marjorie, with
shaking lips, and she pointed to the photograph<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
on which her eyes still rested, in a wild, incredulous
stare.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 320px;">
<img src="images/i-004.jpg" width="320" height="500" alt="&quot;Land Sakes, Missy! What is it?&quot;&mdash;Page 283." title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;<span class='smcap'>Land Sakes, Missy! What is it?</span>&quot;&mdash;Page 283.</span>
</div>

<p>"'Undine,'" repeated Beverly, stupidly, "who
is Undine? That is the picture of my sister
Barbara."</p>

<p>"It's Undine," repeated Marjorie, with obstinate
persistence; "it's exactly like her; I would
know her anywhere."</p>

<p>"But who is Undine? I never even heard of
her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you did; I told you about her once, and
you said I mustn't mention her to your mother,
because she was hurt in the earthquake. We
called her Undine, because she couldn't remember
her real name, or anything that happened
to her before the earthquake. That's her photograph,
Beverly, I tell you it is&mdash;it is!"</p>

<p>Beverly had grown very pale, but he made
a great effort at self-control.</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense, Marjorie," he said, almost
angrily; "I tell you that is my sister's photograph.
I can show you another just like it
at home."</p>

<p>"Beverly," cried Marjorie, clasping her hands,
and speaking in a tone of sudden conviction, "I
am not talking nonsense. That is the picture of
the girl who has been at the ranch since last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
August. She was found in the street just after
the earthquake, half buried under some ruins.
She was unconscious, and they took her to a
hospital. She has never been able to remember
anything about herself since. Your sister was
in the earthquake, too; you think she was killed,
but perhaps&mdash;oh, Beverly dear, let us go home
quick, and tell your uncle all about it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph was in the library reading.
Twice she had put down her book, and gone to
the window to look out. It was growing dark,
and had begun to snow.</p>

<p>"How late they are," she said to herself, with
an anxious glance at the clock. "They ought
to be back by this time, but I suppose they have
stayed listening to Mammy's stories, and forgotten
the time."</p>

<p>She sat down again by the fire, and took up
her book. But she was feeling restless and
nervous that afternoon, though she could not
have told why, and after reading a page, she
closed the book again.</p>

<p>"I wish they would come," she said, impatiently.
"No one knows what may have happened;
they may never have reached Mammy's
cabin. I think I will go and speak to George.
He will laugh at me for worrying, but that will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
be better than sitting here by myself. There's
the clock striking six; they should have been in
an hour ago."</p>

<p>She rose, and was moving towards the door
when she heard an approaching footstep, and in
another moment her brother-in-law himself came
into the room.</p>

<p>"I was just coming to look for you, George,"
she said; "I am getting a little anxious about
the children."</p>

<p>"The children are all right," said the doctor,
quietly, sinking into the arm-chair by the fire;
"they came in half an hour ago, and have gone
to their rooms. Marjorie was feeling a little
upset, and I advised her to go and lie down till
dinner-time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph turned towards the door again.</p>

<p>"I think I will go and see if there is anything
I can do for her," she said. "It isn't like Marjorie
to give up; I'm afraid she isn't well."</p>

<p>But Dr. Randolph held out a detaining hand.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Barbara," he said, "I want to talk
to you. There is nothing the matter with Marjorie
or Beverly either. They have had a long
ride, and stopped at Mammy's for waffles. I
want to ask you a favor. I have just received
some important news, which will necessitate my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
going West at once, and I want you to let Beverly
go with me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph was very much surprised.</p>

<p>"But, George dear," she remonstrated gently,
"college begins again on Monday&mdash;do you
think it wise to take the boy away just now?"</p>

<p>"I shall not be gone more than a week, and
I want Beverly for company. He has never seen
much of his own country, and this trip to Arizona
will do him an immense amount of good.
As for college, a few days more or less won't
make any material difference, and he can make
up for lost time when he gets back."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph still looked doubtful, but the
doctor was Beverly's guardian, and since her
husband's death she had been accustomed to depend
upon his judgment and advice. So instead
of arguing the point, she only said:</p>

<p>"Of course he may go if you think best,
George, only it does seem foolish to take him
away so soon again after his holidays."</p>

<p>"I do think it best, Barbara," said the doctor,
decidedly. "I want the boy with me very much.
I must start as soon as possible. Do you think
you could persuade Emma Patterson to go home
with you and Marjorie to-morrow, and stay till
Beverly and I come back?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can try," said Mrs. Randolph, who was still
unconvinced of the wisdom of this sudden whim
of her brother-in-law's, and a little uneasy as
well. "Emma has promised to visit us later;
perhaps she would be willing to come now instead.
You know, George dear, I never ask you
about your cases, but this seems so very sudden&mdash;are
you going to see a patient?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the doctor, quietly. "I may be
able to tell you more about the case when I come
back, but I cannot now."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph regarded him anxiously.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are not well, George," she
said, "you are dreadfully pale. Is that why
you don't want to take this long journey alone?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. I am perfectly well, but&mdash;well,
the fact is, this may prove a very trying
business, and I want the boy with me."</p>

<p>"Then you shall certainly have him," said Mrs.
Randolph, with decision. "Have you spoken to
Beverly on the subject?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and he is most anxious to go. Now I
must make arrangements about accommodations
on the train, for I want to be off early in the
morning, if possible. Wouldn't it be a good idea
to telephone Emma Patterson at once, and see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
if she can be ready to go with you and Marjorie?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph stood for a moment, looking
after her brother-in-law as he left the room.</p>

<p>"There is something wrong," she said: "I
never saw George so agitated before. I wish I
knew what it was, but doctors don't like to be
questioned. I hate to have Beverly lose a whole
week of college, but if his uncle needs him, I
have nothing more to say." And, with a resigned
sigh, she went away to telephone to her
cousin, Mrs. Patterson.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>UNDINE REMEMBERS</h3>

<div class='poem'>
"'A Highland laddie lives over the lea;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A laddie both noble and gallant and free,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who loved a lassie as noble as he&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A bonnie sweet lassie; the maid of Dundee.'"</span><br />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Graham</span> glanced up from her sewing,
with a smile.</p>

<p>"What a sweet voice that child has," she said;
"with training I believe she would sing remarkably
well."</p>

<p>"I love to hear her singing about the house,"
said Miss Jessie, also pausing to listen to the
clear young voice; "I wonder where she learned
all those old songs. I remember that ballad, but
I haven't heard it since I was a child."</p>

<p>"She probably picks them up from Jim," Mrs.
Graham suggested; "he is always singing about
the place."</p>

<p>"I don't think I ever heard Jim sing this
one," said Miss Jessie, reflectively. "Susie, I
do wish we could find out something about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
child's family. I feel sure she has been brought
up among people of refinement."</p>

<p>"She is a very attractive girl," Mrs. Graham
agreed, "but if she has relatives it seems incredible
that they should never have made the
slightest effort to find her. Donald and I were
talking about her last night. He thinks that
any relatives she had must have been killed in
the earthquake. It seems the only explanation.
There is nothing for us to do but wait patiently
in the hope that Undine may some time be able
to tell us everything herself. I confess I should
be very sorry to part with her; she has been a
great help and comfort since Marjorie went
away."</p>

<p>"She has indeed," said Miss Jessie, heartily.
"I have grown very fond of her, and I think
she cares for us, too. We should have another
letter from Marjorie by this time."</p>

<p>"Yes, Jim has gone for the mail; he may
bring one this afternoon. It does my heart good
to know the dear child is having such a happy
holiday. I would like to write and thank Mrs.
Randolph for all her kindness to Marjorie; she
must be a lovely woman."</p>

<p>"I am sure she is, and the son must be a nice
boy, too, judging from what Marjorie says. Our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
little girl has made some good friends, as I felt
sure she would."</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham rose, and began folding up her
work.</p>

<p>"I must go to the kitchen to look after
Juanita," she said. "It is a lovely afternoon.
Why don't you get Undine to wheel you out in
the sun for an hour?"</p>

<p>"I think I will," said Miss Jessie, with a glance
out of the windows at the cloudless sky and brilliant
winter sunshine. "Ah, here comes Undine.
Undine dear, I think I will go out for a little
while."</p>

<p>The bright-faced, rosy-cheeked girl who entered
the room at this moment was a very different
being from the pale, timid, little waif of four
months earlier. She had grown at least two
inches, and the clothes which had hung loosely
about her in her first days at the ranch had now
become a tight fit. At Miss Jessie's request she
smiled, and came hurrying to the side of her
kind friend.</p>

<p>"It's a glorious day," she said; "it makes
one happy just to be alive. I've had such a
wonderful ride. I went as far as the railroad,
and saw the West Bound pass; it was two hours
late. I'll get your warm coat and some wraps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
and we'll sit behind the playhouse. You won't
feel the wind there, and it will be heavenly."</p>

<p>"Undine," said Miss Graham suddenly, when
the two were comfortably established in one of
their favorite nooks; the invalid in her chair, and
her companion on a rug spread on the ground;
"where did you learn the song I heard you singing
when you came in from your ride just now?"</p>

<p>"I forget which it was," said Undine, looking
puzzled. "Oh, yes, I remember&mdash;'A Highland
Laddie Lived over the Lea.' I don't know
where I learned it&mdash;isn't it one of Jim's songs?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so, dear, but we can ask him.
I never heard you sing it before."</p>

<p>Something of the old, troubled, far-away look
crept into Undine's face.</p>

<p>"I don't know how I remember things," she
said, slowly; "they just come into my head
sometimes. Now that I think of it, I don't believe
I have ever heard Jim sing that song. I
must have heard it somewhere, though."</p>

<p>Miss Graham said nothing, and there was a
short pause, which Undine broke.</p>

<p>"You and Mrs. Graham don't like to have
me talk about the things I can't remember," she
said, a little wistfully.</p>

<p>"Only because we don't want you to distress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
yourself and try to force your brain. I have
always told you I was sure the memory would
come back some day."</p>

<p>"I think it is coming soon," said Undine,
softly. "I keep having dreams. I dreamt of
my mother last night."</p>

<p>There was a quiver in the girl's voice, and
Miss Jessie leaned forward and laid a kind hand
on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it, dear," she said, gently.</p>

<p>Undine drew a deep breath that was almost a
sob.</p>

<p>"It was a beautiful dream," she said. "My
mother and I were in a dear little room, all furnished
in pink and white. I don't know where
it was, but it seemed quite familiar in the dream.
I was unhappy about something, and my mother
kissed me, and put her arms round me. She
had such a dear, beautiful face. Oh, Miss
Jessie, do you suppose my poor mother was
killed in that dreadful earthquake?"</p>

<p>"My dear little girl, we cannot possibly know
that; we must have patience. Have you had
other dreams?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The other night I dreamt I was playing
with a boy in a swamp. There was a black
woman in the dream, too; she scolded us, but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
wasn't a bit afraid of her. Do you think perhaps
they were people I used to know?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, dear; it may be possible, but
you mustn't let these things worry you. You
are happy here with us, are you not?"</p>

<p>"Happy!" cried the girl, with sparkling eyes,
"I never expected to be so happy anywhere. As
long as I live I shall never forget all you and
Mr. and Mrs. Graham have done for me, but I
can't help wanting to remember."</p>

<p>"Of course you can't; that is quite natural.
We all want you to remember, too, but we must
have patience. The more you strain your brain,
the longer it may take for the memory to come
back. You have been a great comfort to us
since Marjorie went away; I told her so in my last
letter."</p>

<p>"I am so glad," said Undine, smiling. "I
promised Marjorie I would try, but of course I
knew I could never take her place. Oh, Miss
Jessie, you said I might read Marjorie's last letter.
It came when I was out, you know, and I
didn't hear you read it to Mrs. Graham."</p>

<p>"So I did, I am glad you reminded me, for
I had forgotten all about it. It was written from
the place in Virginia where she has been spending
the holidays, and tells all about their Christmas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
festivities. It is in the right-hand drawer of
my desk&mdash;you may read it whenever you like."</p>

<p>Undine glanced at the book in Miss Graham's
lap.</p>

<p>"If you don't want me for anything, and are
going to stay here for a while, I think I will go
and read it now," she said; "I love Marjorie's
letters."</p>

<p>"Very well, dear; I want to finish this book
before we begin the one we are going to read
together. It won't take me more than fifteen
minutes."</p>

<p>Undine scrambled to her feet.</p>

<p>"All right," she said; "I'll be back before
that. Oh, Miss Jessie, isn't the air glorious to-day?
It makes me feel so happy and excited;
just as if something were going to happen."</p>

<p>Undine tripped away to the house, and Miss
Graham, as she opened her book, heard the clear
young voice singing:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'A Highland laddie lives over the lea;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A laddie both noble and gallant and free.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>The song died away in the distance, and Miss
Jessie became absorbed in her story. It was
very still, and not a sound came to disturb her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
until she had turned the last page. Then she
closed the book, and looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>"How long Undine takes to read that letter!"
she said to herself, in some surprise.</p>

<p>Another ten minutes slipped away, but Miss
Jessie was accustomed to waiting patiently&mdash;she
had done little else for the past eight years.</p>

<p>"Susie must have kept the child for something,"
she decided, and settled comfortably back
in her chair to await Undine's return.</p>

<p>But it was not like her sister-in-law to detain
Undine without sending some explanation;
neither was it like the girl to remain away so
long. At the end of another ten minutes Miss
Jessie began to be a little curious.</p>

<p>"What can be the matter?" she said uneasily,
her thoughts reverting to a possible accident to
her brother, who had gone to try some new
horses that afternoon. "I think I'll wheel myself
back to the house and find out."</p>

<p>But at that moment she caught sight of her
sister-in-law coming towards her across the lawn.
Mrs. Graham was looking cheerful and serene
as usual, and carried some sewing in her hand.</p>

<p>"I thought I would come and join you," she
said, as soon as she was within speaking distance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
"It's much too lovely to stay in doors. Where's
Undine?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Miss Jessie, "I thought
she was with you. She went in half an hour
ago, to read Marjorie's last letter, which I had
forgotten to show her, and hasn't come back
since."</p>

<p>"I haven't seen her," said Mrs. Graham, looking
a little annoyed, "but then I have been in
the kitchen with Juanita. Undine ought not to
go off like this, and leave you alone so long."</p>

<p>"She never did such a thing before," said Miss
Jessie, anxiously. "I wish you would go and
see where she is, Susie."</p>

<p>"Oh, she is all right, I am sure," Mrs. Graham
maintained, but she turned back towards
the house, nevertheless, for it had also occurred
to her that it was unlike Undine to neglect her
duty.</p>

<p>There was not a sound to be heard when Mrs.
Graham reached the house and although she
called Undine several times, she received no
answer.</p>

<p>"Where can the child be?" she said, beginning
to feel a little frightened, and she hurried to Undine's
room. The door was open, and her first
impression was that the room was empty. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
was turning away again, more and more puzzled
by the girl's mysterious disappearance, when her
eye was caught by a heap of something white
lying on the floor by the window, and in another
moment she had hurried forward, with an exclamation
of dismay, and was bending over Undine,
who lay, white and unconscious on the floor,
with Marjorie's letter clasped convulsively in
her hand.</p>

<p>When Undine opened her eyes she was lying
on her bed, and Mrs. Graham was bathing her
forehead, while the faithful Juanita plied a palm-leaf
fan and held a bottle of smelling-salts to
her nose. For a moment the girl gazed about
her in a kind of dull bewilderment; then a look
of recollection came into her eyes, and she started
up, with a sharp cry.</p>

<p>"I'm not dead, I'm not dead! Oh, tell them
it isn't true! I'm not; I'm not!"</p>

<p>"Lie down, dear," said Mrs. Graham in a tone
of gentle authority. "Of course you are not
dead; you fainted, that is all. You are better
now, and if you lie still for a few minutes you
will be all right."</p>

<p>"But the letter said I was dead," persisted
Undine, wildly, and she fixed her big, terrified
eyes on Mrs. Graham's astonished face. "It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
said Barbara Randolph was dead, and her mother
put flowers on her grave."</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham was beginning to be seriously
alarmed for the girl's reason, but she made an
effort to appear calm.</p>

<p>"My dear child," she said, soothingly, "you
don't know what you are saying. Barbara Randolph
is the daughter of the lady with whom
Marjorie has been staying; she died long ago;
she had nothing to do with you."</p>

<p>"But she didn't die, I know she didn't!" cried
Undine, sitting up, despite all Mrs. Graham's efforts
to keep her quiet. "I knew it when I read
the letter. For one minute I remembered something
horrible. I don't remember it any more
now, but I was so frightened, and&mdash;oh, Mrs.
Graham, I was so terribly frightened!" And
the poor child burst into a fit of wild, hysterical
sobbing, and clung passionately to her kind
friend's neck.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Miss Jessie pushed her wheeled-chair out onto
the porch, and strained her eyes in the gathering
dusk, in the vain hope of seeing some approaching
figure. Fortunately the January evening was
warm, but even if it had been cold she would
scarcely have been aware of the fact. She was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
very anxious, and this long suspense of waiting
was hard to bear. It was more than two hours
since Undine had regained consciousness, and in
all that time the girl had scarcely uttered an intelligible
word. She had passed from one hysterical
fit into another, and Mrs. Graham and
Juanita were at their wits' end. For almost the
first time in twelve years Miss Jessie realized the
awful loneliness of their lives. "Donald must
surely be back soon," she told herself, trying to
be patient, "and Jim will be here with the mail
before long. Oh, that poor child&mdash;what can it
all mean?"</p>

<p>There was a slight sound behind her, and Mrs.
Graham, too, stepped out on the porch. She was
looking pale and distressed.</p>

<p>"How is she now?" Miss Jessie whispered,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"I think she has fallen into a doze; she must
be quite exhausted, poor child. She has had a
terrible shock of some kind."</p>

<p>"Do you think it can have been caused by
anything in Marjorie's letter? She must have
been reading it when she fainted."</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think," said Mrs. Graham,
clasping her hands nervously. "She spoke
of that Randolph girl&mdash;the little girl who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
was killed in the earthquake, you know. Oh,
Jessie, you don't suppose&mdash;" Mrs. Graham did
not finish her sentence, but the two women
looked at each other in the dusk, and both their
faces were pale and startled.</p>

<p>"I must go back," said Mrs. Graham in a
hurried whisper; "I dare not leave her long.
When she wakes she may remember; I think her
memory is coming back. I am afraid you will
take cold out here."</p>

<p>"I am not cold, but I will come in soon. I
am waiting for Donald and Jim. I must warn
them not to speak loud; it might startle her
again."</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham made no further objection, but
went back into the house and Miss Jessie folded
her hands and waited.</p>

<p>Five, ten minutes passed, and then came the
sound of distant hoofs. With a sigh of intense
relief, Miss Jessie sent the wheeled-chair gliding
smoothly off the porch, and across the lawn. The
hoof-beats drew nearer, and now she heard
voices. Was it her brother or Jim, and who
were the others, for she distinctly heard more
than one voice?</p>

<p>"Is it you, Donald?" she called, and in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
still, clear air, her voice was audible an eighth of
a mile away.</p>

<p>"No, Miss, it ain't Mr. Graham, it's me,"
came the answer in Jim's well-known voice.
"I've got some folks with me."</p>

<p>Miss Jessie waited in silence while the hoofs
and voices drew nearer. It was no uncommon
thing for strangers to stop at the ranch, where
they were always sure of a hospitable reception
and a night's lodging. She was glad Jim was
not alone. Perhaps the visitors, whoever they
were, might be able to help, but how she could
not imagine. It was nearly dark, and the first
few stars were beginning to glimmer in the evening
sky.</p>

<p>The horses were very near now, and she could
distinguish three figures, one was Jim Hathaway,
the other two were strangers.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Madame." It was the
elder of the two strangers who spoke; he had
sprung from his horse, and taken off his hat.
Even in the dim light Miss Jessie could see that
he was a gentleman. His companion she noticed
was much younger, scarcely more than a boy indeed,
and he, too, was regarding her with eager,
questioning eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must introduce myself," the gentleman
went on, courteously. "I think you may have
heard Marjorie speak of me. I am Dr. Randolph,
and this is my nephew Beverly."</p>

<p>Miss Jessie gave a little joyful cry, and held
out both hands.</p>

<p>"Is it about Undine?" she whispered breathlessly.
"Have you come for her, and is it really
true that the child is your niece?"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It was some time before Undine awoke from
the heavy sleep of exhaustion into which she had
fallen. She opened her eyes, gazed about her
vaguely, and murmured, "Mother! I want
Mother."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I know," said Mrs. Graham, softly
kissing the girl's hot forehead. "Your mother
isn't here, but she is safe and well, and you shall
go to her very soon."</p>

<p>Undine smiled faintly, and then a troubled
look came into her face.</p>

<p>"I forgot her," she said, dreamily, "I forgot
my mother for a long time, but I remember now,
and I want her&mdash;oh, I want her." And she
stretched out her arms in helpless longing.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Graham moved aside, and some one
else bent over her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>"Babs," said a low, tremulous voice, "Babs
darling, don't you know me? It's Beverly."</p>

<p>With a great cry of joy Undine started up, and
in another second she was clinging convulsively
round her brother's neck.</p>

<p>"Beverly," she sobbed, "oh, Beverly, I remember;
I remember everything. It's all come
back; poor Aunt Helen, that dreadful, dreadful
time! You thought I was dead, and you and
Mother put flowers on my grave; but I wasn't
dead, I had only forgotten. Hold me, Beverly,
hold me tight; I'm so afraid I'm going to forget
again."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>UNDINE TELLS HER STORY</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Undine did not forget again, although
it was some time before she was able to give any
coherent account of what she could remember.
Indeed, she was in such a feverish, hysterical
condition, that Dr. Randolph would not allow any
attempt at questioning her that night.</p>

<p>"She has had a terrible shock, poor child,"
he said to Mrs. Graham. "The reading of that
letter must have brought everything back with
a rush and the knowledge that she had been
mourned as dead for nearly three years was almost
more than she could bear. But she is
young and strong, and a good night's sleep will
do wonders for her. When I think of what we
owe to you and your&mdash;" The doctor's voice
broke suddenly, and he impulsively held out his
hand.</p>

<p>"I think our obligations are mutual," said
Mrs. Graham, smiling, though there were tears
in her eyes. "According to Marjorie's last letter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
you and Mrs. Randolph have been making
our little girl very happy, while your niece has
been a great comfort to us. It is all so strange
and wonderful that I can scarcely realize yet that
it isn't a dream."</p>

<p>It was pitiful to see Undine cling to her
brother; she could not bear to have him out of
her sight for a moment, and Beverly himself,
almost stunned by the great shock of the discovery
that Undine and Barbara were really one
and the same, coming at the end of four days of
almost unendurable suspense, could do little beyond
hovering over his sister, in joy and thankfulness
too deep for words.</p>

<p>"Does Mother know, Beverly?" Undine whispered,
late that evening, when the two were alone
together.</p>

<p>"No, Babs, she doesn't know yet, but we are
going to take you home just as soon as we can.
We couldn't let Mother even suspect until we
were sure ourselves. Marjorie was certain she
recognized your photograph, but Uncle George
and I couldn't believe it was true; it seemed so
impossible."</p>

<p>"Poor, poor Mother," sighed Undine; "oh,
Beverly, how unhappy she must have been!"</p>

<p>"Don't talk about it, Babs; you know Uncle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
George doesn't want you to talk. You must try
to go to sleep, so as to be able to start for home
as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid to go to sleep," protested Undine,
feverishly. "Perhaps when I wake I shall have
forgotten everything again. Oh, Beverly, don't
let me forget again."</p>

<p>"Of course we won't let you," said Beverly,
putting a strong arm around her, protectingly.
"You are quite safe now, you know, Babs darling,
Uncle George and I are here, and we're
going to take you home to Mother."</p>

<p>Undine breathed a deep sigh of relief, as she
nestled in her brother's arms, and when she fell
asleep at last it was with Beverly's hand clasped
fast in hers.</p>

<p>But after a long night's sleep, and a joyful
waking, to find that she had not forgotten again,
Undine was quite a different creature, and during
the morning that followed she was able to
give her uncle and brother a fairly clear account
of her adventures.</p>

<p>"I remember it all quite well now," she said.
"Aunt Helen was ill that night, and she said she
would have the maid sleep in her room, in case
she might need something. I slept in the maid's
room, which was just across the hall. I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
very tired, and I think I must have gone to sleep
as soon as I was in bed, for I don't remember
anything until I woke hearing a terrible noise.
The whole hotel seemed to be rocking, and I saw
some of the things on the bureau fall over, and
a picture came down off the wall. I think I was
too frightened to move, for I lay quite still,
thinking every minute that Aunt Helen would
come and tell me what had happened. In a few
moments the shaking stopped and then I heard
people screaming and running about in the halls.</p>

<p>"Aunt Helen didn't come, or the maid either,
and at last I got up, and went to look for them.
I was in my nightgown and bare feet, but I was
too frightened to stop to put any clothes on. I
ran out into the hall, intending to go to Aunt
Helen's room, but something frightful had happened;
there wasn't any room, only a great pile
of bricks and mortar, and I heard people say
one of the chimneys had fallen in. Oh, it was
terrible&mdash;I can't talk about it!" And the poor
child began to shiver convulsively.</p>

<p>"Never mind about that part of the story,
dear," Dr. Randolph said, soothingly, while
Beverly put his arm round her.</p>

<p>"I called and called to Aunt Helen," Undine
went on in a voice scarcely above a whisper,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
"but nobody answered, and then the house began
to shake again and people screamed that the
walls were falling.</p>

<p>"The next thing I remember is being out in
the street. I don't know how I got there, but
I was running along in my bare feet, in the midst
of a great crowd. I don't know how far I ran
or where I went. I think I must have been
crazed with fright. I tried to speak to people,
but nobody took any notice of me. I heard them
saying there had been a terrible earthquake, and
that the whole city had been destroyed. At last
I got very tired, and I think I must have been
faint too, for everything grew black, and I was
so cold. I remember going inside a doorway,
and thinking I would rest there for a few minutes,
and then the stone must have fallen on my
head, for I don't remember anything more till I
woke up in the hospital, and didn't even know
my name."</p>

<p>"Of course it must have been the poor maid
who was killed," said Beverly. "We never
dreamed of that, because we felt so sure you and
Aunt Helen had roomed together. But Babs
dear, did you never remember anything at all&mdash;not
even the least little thing?"</p>

<p>Undine shook her head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>"I used to have little gleams of memory sometimes,"
she said, "but they were gone again in
a minute. I had one the first time I heard Jim
sing 'Mandalay,' and for one second I think I
almost remembered you, Beverly. Another time
I almost remembered was when Mrs. Graham
was reading a letter from Marjorie, in which she
mentioned your name for the first time. I kept
saying 'Randolph, Randolph' over and over to
myself for a long time, but after the first minute
the words didn't seem to mean anything to me.
It wasn't till yesterday when I read that letter,
and saw all your names together&mdash;Mother's and
yours, and Uncle George's and then that part
about going to Barbara's grave&mdash;that it all
came back with a rush, and I was so frightened
that I fainted."</p>

<p>Later in the day Undine&mdash;or Barbara, as I
suppose we must call her now&mdash;had a long talk
with her uncle. Dr. Randolph had insisted on
Beverly's going out for a walk. The boy was
utterly worn out from excitement and suspense,
and his uncle feared he would be really ill if
precautions were not taken. So he was sent off
for a long tramp over the ranch with Mr. Graham,
and the doctor sat down by his little niece's
bedside, and tried to draw her thoughts away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
from painful memories, by talking of Marjorie,
and of her own life on the ranch.</p>

<p>"They have all been so good to me here, Uncle
George," Barbara said, the grateful tears starting
to her eyes. "If you could have seen me
when I first came! I am sure I looked like a
tramp, and I was so miserable I didn't care much
what became of me. I don't think many people
would have believed my crazy story, but they
took me right in without a word, and have
treated me just as if I belonged to them ever
since. Aren't Mrs. Graham and Miss Jessie
lovely?"</p>

<p>"They are indeed," said the doctor, heartily.
"We owe them a debt of gratitude that can never
be repaid. Miss Graham has one of the sweetest
faces I have ever seen. Has she been a cripple
all her life?"</p>

<p>Barbara caught her breath as a sudden recollection
flashed into her mind.</p>

<p>"Uncle George," she cried excitedly, "aren't
you a great surgeon?"</p>

<p>"I am a surgeon certainly," said her uncle,
smiling, "but I don't know just what you would
call a great one; why do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Barbara, clasping her hands,
and regarding the doctor with shining eyes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
"now Marjorie can have her wish&mdash;the thing
she wants more than anything else in the world,
and that she and I have been praying for all
winter."</p>

<p>And in a few rapid words she told the story of
Miss Graham's accident, and of Marjorie's hopes.</p>

<p>Dr. Randolph said nothing, but he looked much
interested, and when Beverly returned from his
walk, he left the brother and sister together, and
went in quest of Mrs. Graham, with whom he
had a long talk. Then Miss Jessie was taken
into their confidence, and all through the long
afternoon Barbara and Beverly waited in eager
anxiety for their uncle's return.</p>

<p>Mr. Graham was obliged to ride some distance
to another ranch that afternoon, in order to see
a man on business, and it was late in the evening
when he returned, and found his old classmate
waiting for him on the porch.</p>

<p>"Well, and how are things going?" he inquired
cheerfully, when Jim had taken away his
horse. "I trust our little friend is better."</p>

<p>"She is much better, thank you," Dr. Randolph
answered. "She is fast recovering from
the shock, and I hope we may be able to start for
home by the day after to-morrow. Her mother
must be told as soon as possible, and Barbara herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
can scarcely wait to get home. I am going
to make arrangements to leave on the first available
train for the East and&mdash;Graham, I want
to ask you a favor."</p>

<p>"I am sure I shall be glad to do anything in
my power," Mr. Graham said, smiling; "what
is it?"</p>

<p>"I want you to let me take your wife and
sister back to New York with us."</p>

<p>"My wife and sister!" repeated Mr. Graham
in amazement. "Why, my dear boy, my poor
sister hasn't left her wheeled-chair for eight
years. I am sure that she could not stand such
a journey."</p>

<p>"I think she could," said the doctor, quietly.
"I should take a compartment for her, of course,
and she could lie down during the whole trip.
As for the drive to the station, I think that could
also be managed without much discomfort. She
tells me she often takes fairly long drives with
you and your wife. Barbara is still very much
shaken, and will need a woman's care on the
journey. Your wife can be of great assistance
to us, and as to your sister&mdash;well, the fact is,
Graham, I made an examination this afternoon,
with her and Mrs. Graham's consent, and I see
no reason why an operation cannot be performed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
I can't promise an absolute cure, but I have
strong hopes."</p>

<p>Mr. Graham did not speak, but he grasped
his old friend's hand in gratitude too deep for
words, and the doctor went away well satisfied,
to carry the good news to his niece and nephew.</p>

<p>"Oh, how happy Marjorie will be!" cried
Barbara, with sparkling eyes. "When she
wrote me that she had met a great surgeon, but
would never have the courage to speak to him
about her aunt, how little either of us dreamed&mdash;oh,
what a wonderful, beautiful thing it all is!
To think that in five days I shall be with Mother.
You don't think the shock will make her ill, do
you, Uncle George?"</p>

<p>"I hope not, dear, but we must be very careful
how the news is broken to her. Now I want
Beverly to go to bed, and you must try to sleep,
too, Barbara, for you will need all your strength
for the journey, and the meeting with your
mother."</p>

<p>But it was a long time before Barbara fell
asleep that night. Old memories were trooping
back thick and fast, and there was so much that
was happy as well as sad to remember. She
breathed more than one little prayer of thankfulness
to the dear Heavenly Father, who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
watched over her through all her trials and
dangers, and brought her back at last to home
and friends. And when sleep came at last, it
was a peaceful, refreshing sleep, untroubled by
feverish dreams.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>BREAKING THE NEWS</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Do</span> sit down, Marjorie; you haven't been
still for five minutes since luncheon." Elsie
spoke in a tone of weary exasperation, as she
laid down the book she had been trying to read,
and regarded her cousin's flushed cheeks and
sparkling eyes, with a half amused, half annoyed
expression.</p>

<p>Marjorie laughed nervously.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I've been so restless," she said,
"but how can I help it. Just think, they'll be
here this very day, and Mrs. Randolph doesn't
know a single thing yet."</p>

<p>"Of course I know it's the most exciting
thing that ever happened," Elsie admitted, with
resignation, "but one can't help getting tired
even of exciting things when one has heard of
nothing else for a whole week. It will be a week
to-morrow since you got that telegram, and I
don't believe you've thought of another thing
since."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't believe I have," agreed Marjorie,
"but then how could I? Oh, Elsie, I'm so
happy when I think it has all come about through
my recognizing that photograph! Just suppose
Beverly and I hadn't gone to Mammy's cabin
that afternoon. I might never have seen a picture
of Barbara, and the Randolphs might never
have known."</p>

<p>"I wonder how they are going to break the
news to Mrs. Randolph," remarked Elsie, without
heeding her cousin's last observation. "I
should think it would be dreadfully dangerous;
the shock might kill her."</p>

<p>Marjorie's bright face clouded.</p>

<p>"I can't help worrying about it," she said,
"but I am sure Dr. Randolph will find a way of
doing it. It's wonderful to see her so calm, just
doing every-day things, and talking as if nothing
unusual were happening, when we are all so
excited and nervous."</p>

<p>"I really don't see how you managed to keep
her from suspecting when you were on the way
home," said Elsie; "I'm afraid I should have let
out something without intending to."</p>

<p>"I couldn't do that," said Marjorie, gravely.
"Think how terrible it would have been if Mrs.
Randolph had hoped and then been disappointed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
I was sure myself, but neither Dr. Randolph nor
Beverly believed it could be true. I shall never
forget that last evening in Virginia. Beverly and
I were both almost ill from excitement, and yet
we had to act just as if nothing unusual had happened.
Fortunately the doctor and Beverly were
to start the first thing in the morning, so we all
went to bed early. I don't believe any of us slept
a wink; I know I didn't. The day on the train
wasn't quite so bad, because Mrs. Patterson was
with us, and she hadn't been told anything, and
could be natural without trying. I pretended to
be very much interested in a book, so as not to
have to talk much, but I couldn't tell you what it
was about. And all the time Mrs. Randolph was
just as sweet and calm as possible, and worried
about me because my hands were cold, and I
couldn't eat."</p>

<p>"I think you were very plucky," said Elsie.</p>

<p>The bright color rushed into Marjorie's cheeks;
this was the first compliment Elsie had ever paid
her.</p>

<p>"I wasn't at all plucky," she said, modestly;
"any one else would have done the same thing.
I'm glad you think I was, though, for I do want
you to like me."</p>

<p>"Of course I like you," said Elsie, reddening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
in her turn. "There's the door-bell; I wonder if
it's Mamma."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's a letter," cried Marjorie, springing
to her feet; "I ought to have a letter from
home to-day. I haven't heard a word since that
little note from Aunt Jessie the morning after
Barbara was found."</p>

<p>But it was not a letter. Neither was it Mrs.
Carleton, who had gone driving with a friend.
In a moment the faithful Hortense appeared with
a message.</p>

<p>"Madame Randolph has sent to inquire if
Mademoiselle Marjorie will come to her apartment
for a short time. Her friend has been
obliged to go out, and she is alone."</p>

<p>Marjorie clasped her hands in dismay, and
turned a little pale.</p>

<p>"Send word you're very busy, and can't possibly
come," suggested Elsie. But Marjorie
shook her head.</p>

<p>"I shall have to go," she said, with a little
gasp. "Mrs. Randolph has been so good to me;
she would think it so strange if I didn't come
when she sent for me. Say I will be there in a
few minutes, Hortense."</p>

<p>"You really are a wonder, Marjorie," remarked
Elsie, with involuntary admiration, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Hortense left the room with the message. "I'm
sure I should never be able to do it."</p>

<p>"Yes, you would," said Marjorie, smiling
and without another word she followed Hortense
out of the room.</p>

<p>Marjorie's heart was beating very fast when
she rang Mrs. Randolph's bell five minutes later,
but when that lady herself opened the door, and
greeted her guest with her usual serene cheerfulness,
the girl pulled herself together with a
mighty effort, and her friend noticed nothing unusual
in her manner, except that her cheeks were
flushed and her eyes shining.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you could come this afternoon,"
Mrs. Randolph said, leading the way to the sitting-room.
"I haven't seen you for days, and
was beginning to feel quite neglected." She
spoke playfully, but Marjorie felt the gentle reproach
in her tone, and her heart beat faster than
ever.</p>

<p>"Indeed I didn't mean to neglect you," she
said, eagerly, "but&mdash;but you see I have had a
good deal to do since I came home; school began
on Monday."</p>

<p>"I understand, dear," said Mrs. Randolph,
smiling, "and I am not blaming you in the least,
but I have missed you very much."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have had Mrs. Patterson," said Marjorie,
as she took the seat her friend indicated beside
her on the sofa.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, and she has been a great comfort,
for I have missed Beverly terribly. He and the
doctor will be at home this afternoon, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Marjorie; "Mrs. Patterson told
us at luncheon. She said you had a headache; I
hope it's better."</p>

<p>"Much better, thank you, dear. I didn't come
down to luncheon because I wanted to be quite
bright and well this evening when Beverly is
here. This is always a rather sad day for me; it
is my little Barbara's birthday."</p>

<p>Marjorie's heart gave one big jump, and began
throbbing so fast she could scarcely breathe.
She could not have spoken had her life depended
on it, but fortunately Mrs. Randolph did not appear
to expect an answer.</p>

<p>"My little girl would have been fifteen to-day,"
she said, sadly. "It seems hard to realize;
she was such a child when she went away. I
have missed Beverly so much to-day; he and I
always talk of Barbara on her birthday."</p>

<p>"Would you like to talk to me about her, Mrs.
Randolph?" said Marjorie, in a voice that was
scarcely above a whisper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should like it very much. Indeed, that is
why I sent for you. Mrs. Patterson has gone
out. I offered to go with her, but she said she
had some important business to attend to, and
would rather go alone. I am afraid something
is troubling her, and she doesn't want to worry
me about it."</p>

<p>Marjorie, who knew that Mrs. Patterson had
gone to the station to meet the travelers, in answer
to an urgent telegram from Dr. Randolph,
said nothing. Mrs. Patterson, being a nervous,
excitable little woman, had been purposely kept
in ignorance of the real reason of her cousins'
Western trip, and it was in order to break the
news to her that the doctor had wired her to meet
him at the station, and to say nothing on the subject
of her errand to Mrs. Randolph. Consequently,
the poor little lady had been filled by apprehensions
of something dreadful having happened
to one or both of the travelers, and had
departed in a state of perturbation well calculated
to arouse Mrs. Randolph's suspicions that something
was troubling her.</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause, and then Mrs.
Randolph went on.</p>

<p>"I never talk of my little girl to strangers&mdash;it
is all too sacred for that&mdash;but you are not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
stranger any more. I have loved you dearly ever
since we stood together at my Barbara's grave,
and you showed me by your silent sympathy how
well you understood."</p>

<p>Marjorie could not speak, but she took her
friend's hand, and stroked it softly, while Mrs.
Randolph went on, calmly, though with a quiver
in her voice:</p>

<p>"I used to try to make the children's birthdays
as happy as possible; I thought they would be
pleasant memories for them when they were
older. Even the year after my husband died,
when my heart was very sad, I wanted them to
have a merry time. Little children's lives should
never be saddened. I think you would have
loved my little girl, Marjorie; she was very
sweet."</p>

<p>"I know I should," said Marjorie, with a sob,
that was half hysterical.</p>

<p>"I am afraid she was a sad rogue sometimes,"
said Mrs. Randolph, smiling; "Beverly and I
often laugh even now over the memory of some
of her pranks. I want him to remember all the
bright, pleasant things, and not dwell too much
on the sadness."</p>

<p>"Mammy told me about some of Barbara's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
pranks," said Marjorie, "she showed me her
photograph, too."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph unfastened a small gold locket
from a chain she always wore about her neck,
and opened it. Inside was the miniature of a
merry-faced girl of twelve&mdash;the same face that
had looked at Marjorie from the photograph in
Mammy's cabin.</p>

<p>"That was taken only a few weeks before my
little girl went away," she said. "She was just
twelve then. I suppose she would look older
now, but I can never think of Babs as growing
up."</p>

<p>Then Marjorie had an inspiration. How it
came she never knew, but she had yielded to it before
giving herself time to think.</p>

<p>"That picture reminds me of some one I
know," she said, and the moment the words were
out she would have given everything she possessed
to have left them unsaid.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" Mrs. Randolph asked, her eyes
still resting lovingly on the face of the miniature.</p>

<p>"A girl who has been at my home since last
summer," said Marjorie, who was beginning to
feel cold and sick with excitement and apprehension,
but was determined to go on now that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
she had begun. "She came to the ranch one
day all by herself. She had walked all the way
from the railroad. It was a very strange case;
she had had an accident, and forgotten everything
about herself, even her own name."</p>

<p>"Forgotten her name!" said Mrs. Randolph,
incredulously. "What a curious thing&mdash;are
you sure her story was true?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, quite sure. She was such a dear
girl, we couldn't doubt her. Besides Father
wrote to the people she had lived with since her
accident, and they said everything Undine had
told us was true. We called her Undine because
it was pretty, and we didn't know her real name."</p>

<p>"Poor child," said Mrs. Randolph, closing the
miniature as she spoke. "Has she never remembered
anything about herself since?"</p>

<p>"She hadn't a week ago," said Marjorie, wondering
how her shaking lips formed the words,
"but perhaps she may some time. Oh, Mrs.
Randolph, suppose she should remember, and it
should turn out that she had relatives&mdash;brothers
and sisters, and&mdash;and perhaps a mother, who
had been mourning her as dead! Can you think
how her mother would feel? Can you even imagine
it, Mrs. Randolph?"</p>

<p>"I think such joy would be more than any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
mother could bear," said Mrs. Randolph, softly.
"But such strange, romantic things don't often
happen in this world, Marjorie dear. The poor
child's mother is probably dead, or she would
have found her long ago. How did the accident
happen?"</p>

<p>Marjorie gave a great gasp.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we are not quite sure," she said.
"Undine says the people at the hospital told her
a stone must have fallen on her head. She was
found in San Francisco under some ruins, after&mdash;after
the earthquake."</p>

<p>"After the earthquake," repeated Mrs. Randolph
in a strange, startled tone, and she grew
suddenly pale. "Oh, poor, poor child! At least
my little Barbara was spared those horrors. Why
have you never told me about this girl before,
Marjorie?"</p>

<p>"Because Beverly said it made you sad to have
any one speak of the earthquake, and I couldn't
have told Undine's story without mentioning it.
It was dreadful, of course, but she was saved.
Think of it, Mrs. Randolph, she was saved, and
perhaps some time&mdash;" poor Marjorie's over-strained
nerves gave way, and she burst into
tears.</p>

<p>Mrs. Randolph had grown very white; she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
trembling, too, but she laid a firm hand on the
girl's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Marjorie," she cried sharply, "what does this
mean? Why are you telling me all this? Something
has happened, I know it has&mdash;oh, Marjorie,
for God's sake tell me what it is! My little
girl is dead; they brought her home to me,
though they would not let me see her dear face.
Marjorie, why do you cry so? You must tell me
at once, do you hear? I say at once."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Randolph, darling Mrs. Randolph,
it isn't anything sad, indeed it isn't," sobbed Marjorie,
with her arms about her friend's neck.
"It's something beautiful; more beautiful and
wonderful than you can ever imagine. I can't say
any more, but Beverly will be here very soon, and
he will tell you. Try to think of the very greatest
joy that could possibly come to any one,
and perhaps you will begin to have an idea what
it is."</p>

<p>Marjorie paused, conscious of the fact that
some one had entered the room. In their excitement
neither she nor Mrs. Randolph had noticed
the opening of the door, or the sound of an approaching
footstep. But now as she lifted her
face from her friend's shoulder, Marjorie saw
two figures standing on the threshold; they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Dr. Randolph and Beverly. At the same moment
Mrs. Randolph also recognized them, and held
out her arms to her son.</p>

<p>"Beverly," she cried, "tell me what it is!
You know, I see it in your face. Oh, Beverly,
my darling, it isn't&mdash;it can't be news of Barbara?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mother, it is!" cried the boy, gathering
her in his strong arms. "Can you bear a great
shock, Mother&mdash;a great joyful shock?&mdash;because
if you can, Uncle George and I have something
to tell you."</p>

<p>Marjorie waited for no more; such scenes were
not for other eyes to see or other ears to hear.
With a bound, she was out of the room, and flying
across the corridor. In her flight she darted
by two other figures without even seeing them; a
trembling, white-faced girl clinging nervously to
an older woman, whose face was scarcely less
white than her own. She had but one thought:
to reach her room before the burst of hysterical
excitement completely overpowered her. A frantic
ring at the Carletons' bell, and then the door
was thrown open, and she was clinging to some
one&mdash;presumably Hortense&mdash;crying and laughing
both together.</p>

<p>"Oh, Hortense, Hortense," she wailed, "I've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
told her, and they've come! You don't think the
shock will kill her, do you?"</p>

<p>But it was not Hortense who answered, or
who held the hysterical child in loving, motherly
arms.</p>

<p>"Marjorie, my dear little Marjorie, don't
tremble so! Everything will be all right, my
darling, I know it will, and here are Aunt Jessie
and I come all the way from Arizona to give you
a big surprise."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>MARJORIE HAS HER WISH</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Marjorie</span> declared afterwards that she was
sure that was the happiest moment of her life,
but at the time the joyful surprise, coming so
soon after the nervous strain of the past hour,
proved almost too much for her, and she could
do nothing for some time but hold her mother
tight, and cry as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>"It's the one thing I've been wishing for every
day, and praying for every night since I came to
New York," Marjorie said to her aunt, late that
evening, when Miss Graham was in bed, and her
niece was sitting beside her, holding her hand.
"But I never dared hope it would really happen,
even when I knew Dr. Randolph had gone to Arizona.
We were all so excited about Barbara; it
didn't seem as if he or Beverly would be able to
think of anything else."</p>

<p>"It was all Undine's doing," said Miss Jessie,
smiling. She was looking pale and tired, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
very happy and Marjorie gazed at her aunt, with
shining eyes.</p>

<p>"You know it was Undine who told her uncle
about my accident," the invalid went on. "Dr.
Randolph made an examination, and he hopes
that I may be much helped by an operation. He
is going to bring another surgeon to see me to-morrow,
and if they agree in their opinion, I am
to go to a hospital."</p>

<p>Miss Graham spoke cheerfully, but there was a
slight tremor in her voice, and Marjorie grew
suddenly grave. They were both silent for a
moment, and then Marjorie said:</p>

<p>"Isn't Beverly a dear, and don't you like Dr.
Randolph ever so much, too?"</p>

<p>"I do indeed," said Miss Jessie, heartily. "I
shall never forget their kindness during that long
journey. As for Undine, she could not have
been more devoted to me if she had been my own
little niece. It has been a wonderful experience,
Marjorie; I never expected to see the East
again."</p>

<p>Marjorie bent and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Beautiful things do happen in the world as
well as sad ones, don't they?" she said, softly.
"When I think of you and Mother being here,
and of Mrs. Randolph having found her Barbara,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
my heart is so full it seems as if it must
surely burst. Here comes Mother; perhaps she
will be able to tell us how Mrs. Randolph has
borne the shock."</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham's news was most reassuring.</p>

<p>"I have seen Beverly," she said, "and he says
his mother is quite calm now. At first they were
anxious about her, but only for a little while.
Beverly says his uncle thinks it was a fortunate
thing you were able to prepare her a little before
they came, Marjorie; otherwise it would have
been more difficult to break the news to her."</p>

<p>Marjorie gave a long sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad it wasn't wrong," she said. "I
was horribly frightened after I had begun, but
when Mrs. Randolph showed me that picture, it
came to me all at once to tell her about Undine.
I thought that if she heard of one girl who was
saved from the earthquake, she might be able to
believe that another girl was saved, too."</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham and Miss Jessie both smiled, and
then Mrs. Graham said she must obey the doctor's
instructions, and see that her sister-in-law was
kept quiet, and went to sleep early.</p>

<p>Marjorie and her mother had a long talk that
night, after Aunt Jessie was asleep, and the girl
opened her heart as she had not done since leaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
home, and Mrs. Graham learned of many
things that she had not been told in letters.</p>

<p>"I think Elsie really does like me now," finished
Marjorie, when she had told of the many
heartaches caused by the fear that her cousin did
not like her. "She has been very sweet since I
came back from Virginia, and just as kind and
sympathetic as she could be."</p>

<p>Mrs. Graham looked pleased.</p>

<p>"Elsie has been spoiled," she said, "but I believe
she has the right stuff in her, after all. I
am glad you have told me all these things, dear,
although I understand your reasons for not writing
them. You have had a harder time than I
suspected, but I don't think it has done you any
harm. Do you know, Marjorie, I am inclined to
be rather proud of my little girl?"</p>

<p>Those last words of her mother's filled Marjorie's
cup to the brim, and I doubt if in all the
great city that night, there were two happier beings
than she and Barbara Randolph.</p>

<p>But it was not all happiness for Marjorie during
the next few days. There followed hours of
keen anxiety about Aunt Jessie, and for a time
she forgot everything else while she waited in suspense
for the verdict of the two great surgeons.</p>

<p>It was on an afternoon three days later, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
she and Barbara sat together in the Randolphs'
parlor, waiting for the news, which was to tell
them whether Jessie Graham was to go through
life a helpless cripple, or be restored to health and
strength once more. The day before she had
been taken to a private hospital, and the girls
knew that an operation was to be performed that
afternoon. They were alone, for Mrs. Graham
was with her sister-in-law, and Mrs. Randolph&mdash;almost
as anxious as the others&mdash;had gone to
the hospital for news, promising to return as soon
as possible. So Marjorie and Barbara sat together
side by side on the sofa, holding each
other's hands, and waiting in almost breathless
suspense.</p>

<p>"Mother will be sure to let us know just as
soon as there's anything to tell," whispered Barbara,
anxious to cheer her friend. "She says
Uncle George told her he was very hopeful."</p>

<p>"I know," said Marjorie, "he told us all so,
but I can't help being frightened when I think of
all it means to Aunt Jessie. She doesn't say
much, but I know how she must feel. Just think
how we would feel if we hadn't walked a step for
more than eight years."</p>

<p>"Where is your cousin this afternoon?" inquired
Barbara, by way of changing the subject.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
She was almost as anxious as Marjorie, but she
had been living at high pressure for so long, it
was a relief to get down to commonplaces.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Marjorie; "she was going
out, but it rained so hard Aunt Julia wouldn't
let her go, on account of her cold. Aunt Julia is
very fussy about colds."</p>

<p>"Don't you think she would like to come in
here with us?" suggested Barbara. "She may
be lonely all by herself."</p>

<p>"I don't believe she is lonely," said Marjorie,
doubtfully, "but if you think she might like to
come&mdash;"</p>

<p>A ring at the door-bell brought Marjorie's sentence
to an abrupt end, and both girls sprang to
their feet.</p>

<p>"I'll see who it is," said Barbara; "it may be
a message from Mother." And she flew to open
the door, while Marjorie sank back in her seat,
feeling suddenly cold and sick with fear.</p>

<p>But it was not a message from Mrs. Randolph;
it was Elsie.</p>

<p>"I just came to ask if you had heard anything
yet," she said, looking rather embarrassed, as she
noticed the expression of disappointment on Barbara's
face.</p>

<p>"No, we haven't," Barbara answered; "we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
thought it might be a message when we heard the
bell. Won't you come in?"</p>

<p>Elsie hesitated.</p>

<p>"Do you really want me?" she asked, doubtfully;
"I thought perhaps you would rather be
by yourselves."</p>

<p>"Of course we want you," declared Barbara,
heartily, while Marjorie&mdash;in the background&mdash;gave
a little gasp of astonishment. Such humility
from the proud Elsie was something that had
never entered her imagination.</p>

<p>Elsie made no remark, but she came in, and
followed Barbara to the sitting-room, where Marjorie
smiled a welcome which appeared to set her
cousin more at her ease.</p>

<p>"I am sure you must be almost as anxious as
we are," said Barbara, "though of course you
don't know Miss Jessie as well. No one could
help loving her."</p>

<p>"No, they couldn't," agreed Elsie, in a rather
low voice, and then she walked over to the window,
and stood with her back to the others, looking
out at the falling rain.</p>

<p>Nobody talked much during the next half-hour.
Marjorie and Barbara both had lumps in
their throats, and words did not come easily.
Elsie, too, was unusually silent. There was another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
little excitement when the bell rang again,
and Beverly came in. Beverly had been through
a great deal during the past two weeks, but boys
of eighteen cannot live on high pressure for very
long without a reaction setting in. Beverly was
a very natural, healthy-minded boy, and the reaction
in his case took the form of unusually high
spirits.</p>

<p>"Don't all have such long faces," he remarked,
cheerfully, surveying the solemn little
group. "Just make up your minds everything is
coming out all right, and you'll see it will. I've
got more faith in Uncle George than in any other
surgeon in the country. Think of what he did
for that English boy we met at the Bells'."</p>

<p>"I know Uncle George is wonderful," said
Barbara, a trifle more hopeful, "but even he may
not be able to cure everybody. You would be
just as anxious as Marjorie and I, Beverly, if you
knew dear Miss Jessie as well as we do."</p>

<p>"I didn't say I wasn't anxious. I only said
I didn't see any use in such long faces before you
know whether there was anything to be mournful
about. How do you do, Miss Elsie? I haven't
seen you in a week of Sundays."</p>

<p>In his present exuberant spirits, Beverly was
quite ready to forget past unpleasantness, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Elsie had not forgotten, as her heightened color
and embarrassed manner plainly showed.</p>

<p>Beverly went to the piano, and began playing
rag-time, with the cheerful desire of raising the
drooping spirits of the party. He proposed they
should sing college songs, but nobody felt inclined
for singing and the attempt proved a dismal
failure.</p>

<p>"What a very uncomfortable thing suspense
is," remarked Barbara, as the clock struck five.</p>

<p>"You would say so if you had been through
the suspense Marjorie and I have," her brother
said. "We know something of what suspense
means, don't we, Marjorie?"</p>

<p>"Indeed we do," said Marjorie, rousing herself
from present anxieties with an effort. "Oh,
Beverly, those awful days when you and your
uncle were on your way to Arizona, and I
couldn't be absolutely sure I hadn't made a mistake
about that photo after all. Suppose I had
been mistaken, and you had had that terrible disappointment!"</p>

<p>"Well, you were not mistaken, you see," broke
in Beverly, who felt that the recollection of those
days was still too vivid to bear discussion.
"Come and sit by me, Babs," and he made room
for his sister on the piano stool.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>But all suspense, however long, must come to
an end at last, and just as the clock was striking
half past five, there was another ring at the bell,
followed by a simultaneous rush to the door.
Only Marjorie remained behind. Until that moment
she had scarcely realized how great her anxiety
was, and her knees shook so that she could
not rise from her chair. She heard all the others
talking at once, apparently asking some question,
and then Mrs. Randolph's voice, but she could not
hear her words.</p>

<p>"Marjorie, Marjorie, where are you?" cried
Barbara joyfully; "here's Mother!"</p>

<p>"I'm here," said Marjorie, faintly, and the
next moment Mrs. Randolph was beside her,
holding both her cold hands. Marjorie's eyes
asked the question her lips refused to form, and
Mrs. Randolph bent and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Marjorie dear," she said in a voice that was
not quite steady, though she was smiling, "your
mother wanted me to tell you that the operation
is over, and that Dr. Randolph feels almost certain
it has been successful."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>ELSIE REDEEMS HERSELF</h3>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Do</span> you know, Aunt Jessie, that to-morrow
will be the first of May? It's nearly four months
since you and Mother came to New York."</p>

<p>Miss Graham was leaning back in a comfortable
arm-chair by an open window, through
which the bright spring sunshine was pouring,
flooding every corner of the pleasant hotel bedroom.
She was still looking rather frail and delicate,
but there was an expression of hope and joy
in her face, that had never been there in the old
days at the ranch. A crutch stood at her side,
but there was no wheeled-chair to be seen. At
Marjorie's words she looked round with a smile.</p>

<p>"Time has certainly flown," she said. "Have
you had a pleasant ride?"</p>

<p>"It was glorious. Beverly and I had a
splendid gallop. I hope you enjoyed your drive."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was lovely," said Miss Jessie, secretly
thinking that Marjorie had grown very pretty
lately. She looked so well in her perfectly fitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
riding habit, with her rosy cheeks and sparkling
eyes. "I wasn't at all tired when I came home
either, which Dr. Randolph considers a distinct
gain. He says I am one of his star patients.
Have you finished your lessons for to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Haven't any; it's Saturday, you know. I
shall have plenty of time to study between now
and Monday. I came to have a little chat with
you before I dress. I'm going out this evening,
you remember. It's the last meeting of the Club,
and quite an important occasion. The Bells are
sailing for Europe to-morrow, and Lulu is our
president."</p>

<p>"I thought you wrote me that Elsie was elected
president," said Miss Graham, who seldom forgot
anything Marjorie told her.</p>

<p>"She was at first," said Marjorie, hoping her
aunt would not notice her suddenly heightened
color. She drew a low chair to Miss Jessie's
side, and settled herself for a comfortable chat.</p>

<p>"Why did she give it up?" Miss Graham inquired,
with interest.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't exactly know. It was after I
came back from Virginia and Barbara came
home. She said she would rather not be president
any more, and asked Lulu to take her
place."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>"I like Elsie," said Miss Jessie. "She is very
clever, and has been rather spoiled in consequence,
but there is much that is fine about her.
She will make a noble woman, I am sure."</p>

<p>Marjorie looked pleased.</p>

<p>"Elsie likes you," she said, "and I don't think
she is really fond of many people. She hasn't
nearly as many friends as most of the girls at
school have, but I love her dearly, and so does
Babs."</p>

<p>"I had a letter from your father this afternoon,"
Miss Jessie said, after a little pause; "I
am keeping it for you to read. He says things
are looking up at the ranch, and he is hoping for
a better season than last. He thinks he may possibly
be able to come East for us himself next
month. I do hope he can, for it would be such
a treat for him."</p>

<p>"I suppose he is thankful to get Mother back,"
said Marjorie, "but, oh, how we do miss her,
don't we, Aunt Jessie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, but it wouldn't have been fair
to have kept her any longer when she was so
anxious to get home to your father. After all,
she had a good long rest, and your father declares
she is looking ten years younger in consequence."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a wonderful winter it has been," said
Marjorie, reflectively, resting her knee against
her aunt's knee. "When I left home last October,
how little any of us dreamed of all the
strange, beautiful things that were going to happen.
Those first weeks were pretty hard; I was
a good deal more homesick than I let any of you
know, but I knew everybody meant to be kind
and I did try hard to make the best of things.
Then came the Randolphs' invitation to spend the
holidays in Virginia, and the wonderful discovery
about Undine. And then&mdash;as if that wasn't
happiness enough&mdash;Dr. Randolph saw you, and
brought you and Mother back to New York with
him. The operation was pretty dreadful, but
ever since Dr. Randolph told us he was sure it
had been a success, everything has been simply
heavenly."</p>

<p>Miss Jessie said nothing, but softly stroked
Marjorie's hair, and there was such a look of joy
in her eyes, that the girl could not help being
struck by it.</p>

<p>"Aunt Jessie," she said, laughing, "do you
know, I never realized before how young you are.
I used to think of you as quite a middle-aged
lady, but I don't know how it is, you look different
now somehow&mdash;almost like a girl."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was twenty-nine last week," said Miss Jessie,
smiling; "I suppose twenty-nine may seem
middle-aged to fifteen."</p>

<p>"But it doesn't," protested Marjorie; "not a
bit; I think I must have been a goose ever to have
thought such a thing. Beverly calls you a perfect
trump, and he wouldn't say that about any
one he considered middle-aged; it wouldn't be respectful."</p>

<p>"I am very much obliged to Beverly for his
good opinion," said Miss Jessie, laughing and
blushing in such a very girlish manner that her
niece regarded her in growing astonishment.</p>

<p>"I believe it's the thought of being well and
strong again that has made all the difference,"
she said. "Oh, Aunt Jessie darling, think of it,
you'll never have to sit in that dreadful wheeled-chair
again! What walks and rides we'll have
together. Are you sure Dr. Randolph will let
you go back to the ranch in June?"</p>

<p>"He says I shall be quite strong enough for
the journey by that time," Miss Graham answered,
but she did not meet Marjorie's direct
gaze as she spoke. "I feel that I ought not to
trespass on the Randolphs' hospitality any longer
than is necessary. Think of what they have done
for me, Marjorie. First all those weeks at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
hospital, and then insisting on my coming here,
and all of it just because we were kind to Undine."</p>

<p>"I don't think that is the only reason," said
Marjorie, eagerly. "That was the beginning of
it, of course, but now they all love you for yourself.
Babs says her mother loves you dearly,
and she and Beverly were both so pleased because
you said they might call you 'Aunt Jessie.' As
for the doctor, I'm sure he likes you ever so
much."</p>

<p>"There's some one at the door; go and see who
it is, Marjorie."</p>

<p>Marjorie rose obediently, wondering what could
have possibly caused her aunt's sudden embarrassment,
and when she returned she was followed
by Barbara, who had also dropped in for
a little chat, Miss Jessie's room being a favorite
rendezvous with all the young people.</p>

<p>"Well, and what have you been doing this
afternoon?" Miss Graham asked pleasantly, as
Barbara settled herself for a comfortable half-hour.</p>

<p>"I went for a walk with Elsie and Hortense.
We had a nice time, but I don't think Elsie felt
very well, she was so quiet. I asked her if her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
head ached, and she said no, but I'm afraid it
did."</p>

<p>"I don't think Elsie has seemed quite like herself
for several days," said Miss Jessie, a little
anxiously. "Perhaps she is studying too hard;
her mother tells me she is so very ambitious."</p>

<p>Neither of the girls had any explanation to
suggest, and they all chatted on pleasantly on
various subjects until it was time to go away and
dress for dinner. Barbara was also going to the
Club that evening, having been admitted as a
guest of honor some months before. Indeed, she
was quite the heroine of the hour, for the romantic
story had quickly spread from friends and
acquaintances to strangers, and she had even been
written about in several newspapers, a circumstance
which had filled the breasts of some other
girls with envy. For several weeks there was
not a girl in the city so much talked about as
Barbara Randolph, the child who had been
mourned as dead by her family for nearly three
years, and then reappeared under conditions sufficiently
interesting and romantic to fill the pages
of a thrilling story-book. The Randolphs disliked
the publicity, but Barbara was pursued by
reporters and photographers until Beverly lost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
his temper, and positively refused to allow any
member of the family to grant another interview.</p>

<p>"How does it feel to know that everybody in
New York is talking about you, and all the papers
asking for your picture?" Elsie had asked one
day, to which Barbara had answered, with a
laugh:</p>

<p>"I don't know that I have any particular feelings
about it. I am too happy at being at home
again with Mother and Beverly to care for anything
else in the world."</p>

<p>Elsie was nowhere to be seen when Marjorie
returned to her uncle's apartment, and the cousins
did not meet till they were both dressed for the
evening, and had joined Mr. and Mrs. Carleton
in the drawing-room. Then Mrs. Carleton's first
words were an anxious question.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you are feeling quite well this
evening, Elsie darling? You are very pale."</p>

<p>"Of course I'm all right," said Elsie, crossly.
"I do wish you wouldn't fuss so much about me,
Mamma."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton sighed.</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't intend to fuss," she said,
plaintively, "but how can I help worrying when
I see you looking so badly, especially when you
will insist on studying so hard?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Mr. Carleton, looking up
from his evening paper, with a frown. "I have
looked over Elsie's lessons, and there is nothing
wrong there. She isn't studying any harder than
a healthy girl of her age should. What's the
matter, Elsie&mdash;don't you feel quite up to the
mark?"</p>

<p>He spoke kindly, but his tone was a trifle impatient,
and before Elsie could reply, her mother
began again.</p>

<p>"She won't tell you; she insists there is nothing
the matter, but she has not looked like herself
for days. If she isn't better to-morrow I shall
have the doctor see her, and give her a tonic."</p>

<p>Mr. Carleton threw down his newspaper.</p>

<p>"My dear Julia," he said, "I believe you consider
a tonic a cure for every evil in the world.
The girls are ready, so let us go down to dinner,
and see if Elsie doesn't make up for her loss of
appetite at luncheon."</p>

<p>But Elsie did not make up for her lack of appetite
at luncheon. She toyed with her food, and
her color changed so often, from white to red,
and back to white again, that by the time dinner
was over even her father began to look at her
curiously. But when Mrs. Carleton suggested
that she should not go to Gertie Rossiter's, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
the Club was to be held that evening, she protested
that she was perfectly well, and was so decided
in her determination to go, that, as usual,
she had her way.</p>

<p>The meeting was at eight, and Marjorie and
Elsie were obliged to hurry away from the dinner
table to join the two Randolphs, as the four
were to go together in the Carletons' carriage.</p>

<p>"Uncle George says we might have had his
car as well as not," remarked Barbara, as they
took their seats in the carriage. "He has come
to spend the evening with Mother and Aunt Jessie,
and won't need it."</p>

<p>"Your uncle is very generous with his car,"
said Marjorie, innocently. "He lent it to your
mother and Aunt Jessie this afternoon, you know,
and Aunt Jessie said they had a beautiful ride."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle George would do anything in the
world for Aunt Jessie," remarked Barbara, at
which her brother smiled a rather mischievous
smile, but said nothing.</p>

<p>There was an unusually large gathering of the
Club that evening, in honor of the president, who,
with her family, was to sail for Europe the following
day. As it was a gala occasion, no sewing
was to be done, and the boys were invited to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
come with the girls, and devote the evening to
dancing and games.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid our sewing really hasn't amounted
to very much," Winifred Hamilton remarked ruefully.
"Mother says she's afraid the Blind
Babies would be badly off if they had to depend
upon us for clothes, but we've had an awfully
jolly winter, and I'm sorry it's over, aren't you,
Mr. Randolph?"</p>

<p>"Well, summer is pretty jolly, too, you know,"
answered Beverly, smiling. "I sha'n't be sorry
to have vacation begin. We are going abroad as
soon as college closes."</p>

<p>"How nice," said Winifred, looking interested;
"perhaps you'll meet the Bells. They expect
to stay over till October. I really don't
know how I shall manage to get on so long without
Lulu."</p>

<p>"Why don't you go, too?" Beverly asked,
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"I should love to, but I couldn't leave Mother.
Dr. Bell offered to take me, and Father and
Mother said I might go if I liked, but I couldn't
make up my mind to leave them. Perhaps some
day we shall go ourselves," finished Winifred,
trying to look hopeful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll let you into a little secret if you'll promise
not to tell," said Beverly, who had a genuine liking
for Winifred, despite the fact that she was
"young for her age." "My mother is very anxious
to have Marjorie go with us, provided her
parents will consent. Miss Graham thinks they
will, and Mother has written to ask them before
speaking to Marjorie herself. Mind you don't
tell, for it's a great secret. Even Babs doesn't
know, for she and Marjorie are such chums she
would be sure to let something out. Hello!
what's up? Lulu is going to make a speech."</p>

<p>There was a sudden hush as Lulu, with Elsie
at her side, stepped forward, and rapped sharply
on the table, to call the club to order.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," she began in what
the girls called "her presidential tone," "I didn't
expect to have any regular meeting this evening,
but Miss Elsie Carleton has an announcement to
make, and has asked me to tell you she would like
to speak. As you all know Miss Carleton was
your president until she resigned in favor of another,
I am sure you will all be pleased to hear
what she has to say. Go ahead, Elsie; everybody's
listening."</p>

<p>All eyes were turned in surprise upon Elsie, as
she stood before them, very pale, but with a look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
of settled determination on her face. Twice she
tried to speak, and stopped, and they could all see
that she was very nervous. Then the words
came, very low, but sufficiently audible to reach
every ear in the room.</p>

<p>"Girls," she began, looking straight before her,
and clasping and unclasping her hands as she
spoke, "girls and boys, too, for I want you all
to hear. I have a confession to make. It's about
something that happened at the first meeting of
this Club&mdash;the night we were all initiated.
That poem I wrote&mdash;some of you thought it was
the best, and you made me president&mdash;it&mdash;it
wasn't original; I learned it when I was a little
girl, but I thought nobody would recognize it.
I didn't mean to cheat at first, but I couldn't
make up anything that I thought was good
enough, and I hated to have the other poems better
than mine. I haven't anything more to say
except that I've been ashamed of myself ever
since, and I can't have you go on thinking me
cleverer than I am, any longer." And then,
without waiting to note the effect of her startling
announcement, Elsie turned and fled.</p>

<p>Marjorie and Barbara found her upstairs in
the dressing-room, crying as if her heart would
break. Neither of them said a word, but Marjorie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
put her arms round her cousin's neck and
hugged her.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 317px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;<span class='smcap'>It Takes a Lot of Pluck to Get up and Say a Thing like that.</span>&quot;&mdash;Page 355.</span>
</div>

<p>"What are they saying about me?" whispered
Elsie, burying her face on Marjorie's shoulder.
"Do they all despise me?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," declared Marjorie, reassuringly.
"They're all saying how plucky it was of
you to confess. Lulu says she never liked you so
much before in her life. As for me, I'm so
proud of you I don't know what to do. Oh, Elsie
darling, I'm so glad you did it!"</p>

<p>"It was you who made me do it," sobbed
Elsie, clinging to her cousin. "You were so
splendid about it all. You knew, and yet you
never told any one, not even Papa when he was
provoked with you, because you wouldn't explain
what the trouble between us was. Your brother
knew too, Babs, and he has never said a word,
but I know how he has despised me. I've despised
myself too&mdash;oh, how I have despised myself!
I've been selfish and conceited all my life,
and I didn't care much, but one can't help feeling
mean and ashamed beside girls like you, and
brave, wonderful women like Aunt Jessie. I
don't believe I've got one real friend in the
world."</p>

<p>"You've got lots," protested Marjorie and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
Barbara both together. "Just come downstairs
and see if you haven't."</p>

<p>It was a very quiet, subdued Elsie who re&euml;ntered
the drawing-room, escorted by her two
staunch friends, but the welcome she received
was such that, before the evening was over, she
found herself able to smile, and take a passing
interest in life once more. Elsie had many
faults, but she was not a bad girl, and she had
learned a lesson that would last her all her life.
One of the first to approach her and hold out his
hand, was Beverly Randolph.</p>

<p>"You're a trump, Elsie," he said, in his blunt,
boyish way. "It takes a lot of pluck to get up
and say a thing like that. Let's shake hands and
be friends." And at that moment Elsie was happier
than she had been in months.</p>

<p>"I think I'll just stop a minute to say good-night
to Aunt Jessie," remarked Marjorie, as
they were going up to their apartment in the lift.
"I don't believe she has gone to bed yet if Dr.
Randolph is spending the evening. Tell Aunt
Julia I'll be right up, Elsie."</p>

<p>So Marjorie stepped out of the lift with the
Randolphs, while Elsie went up another floor to
her own apartment. Mrs. Randolph had insisted
that Miss Graham should be her guest on leaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
the hospital, and one of the most comfortable
rooms in the apartment had been assigned to her.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Randolph herself who opened the
door for the young people; she was smiling, and
looked as if she were pleased about something.</p>

<p>"Has Aunt Jessie gone to bed?" Marjorie
asked.</p>

<p>"No, dear, she is in the parlor with Uncle
George, and I think she wants to see you."</p>

<p>Barbara hurried her mother off to her room, to
tell of the events of the evening, and Beverly
followed, at a mysterious signal from Mrs. Randolph,
so Marjorie was the only one to enter the
cozy little parlor, where she found her aunt and
the doctor sitting on the sofa side by side.</p>

<p>"I just came in for a minute to say good-night,"
she began. "I've had a lovely evening,
and&mdash;and&mdash;" here Marjorie paused abruptly,
struck by something unusual in the faces of her
two listeners.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is anything the matter?" she inquired
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Do we look as if there were?" inquired the
doctor, and he smiled such a radiant smile that
Marjorie's sudden anxiety melted into thin air.</p>

<p>"No, not exactly, but Aunt Jessie looks so&mdash;so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
different. Oh, Aunt Jessie darling, I know
something has happened&mdash;is it good news?"</p>

<p>"The very best news in the world for me,"
said the doctor, laughing, while Aunt Jessie drew
her niece into her arms, and hid her smiling,
blushing face on Marjorie's shoulder. "Your
aunt has promised to give me something that I
want more than anything else. Marjorie, do you
think you would like to have me for an uncle?"</p>

<p>"And that was just the crowning happiness of
all," said Marjorie, when she and Elsie were talking
things over half an hour later. "I thought
I was just as happy as any girl could be before,
but when I saw that look on Aunt Jessie's face,
and thought of all she had suffered, and how
brave she had been, it seemed as if my heart
would burst with gladness. It's just the most
beautiful ending to a beautiful winter."</p>

<p>"I wish I had done more to make the first part
of the winter happy," said Elsie, with a remorseful
sigh. "I don't see why you didn't hate me,
Marjorie; I'm sure I deserved it."</p>

<p>"Why, I couldn't," said Marjorie, simply,
"you were my own cousin, you know."</p>

<p>Elsie went up to her cousin, and put her arms
round her. That was such an unusual proceeding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
from cold, undemonstrative Elsie that Marjorie
was speechless with astonishment.</p>

<p>"I believe you are the best girl in the world,
Marjorie," she said, unsteadily. "I'm not
worthy of your friendship, but if you will really
love me, and forgive me for all the mean, hateful
things I've done, I will try to deserve it&mdash;I will
indeed."</p>

<div class='cap'>THIS is considerably longer than the other
books by this favorite writer, and with a
more elaborate plot, but it has the same winsome
quality throughout. It introduces the
heroine in New York as a little girl of eight,
but soon passes over six years and finds her at
a select family boarding school in Connecticut.
An important part of the story also takes place
at the Profile House in the White Mountains.
The charm of school-girl friendship is finely
brought out, and the kindness of heart, good
sense and good taste which find constant expression
in the books by Miss Rhoades do not
lack for characters to show these best of
qualities by their lives. Other less admirable
persons of course appear to furnish the alluring mystery, which is not
all cleared up until the very last.</div>
